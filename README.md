#
### Mathematical Concept

The mathematics used in assessing Improvement Value (IV) involves calculating key performance metrics across four dimensions: usability, efficiency, satisfaction, and impact. These metrics are based on formulas designed to quantify various types of improvement. For example, in usability, the Task Completion Rate is measured as the percentage of successful tasks completed after improvements, while the **Error Rate** tracks reductions in user mistakes. In efficiency, formulas such as Time Savings and Cost Reduction evaluate the percentage decrease in the time or cost required to perform tasks, providing a clear numerical reflection of increased operational efficiency. These formulas allow businesses to track quantifiable changes in how their products or services perform after modifications.

In addition to individual metrics, businesses often aggregate multiple measurements to determine the overall Improvement Value (IV). This is typically done using a weighted average formula where different dimensions (usability, efficiency, satisfaction, and impact) are assigned importance based on business priorities. For instance, a company may weigh efficiency more heavily than satisfaction, depending on its goals. The use of weights in the formula `IV = w_U × U + w_E × E + w_S × S + w_I × I` helps businesses understand not only how well individual aspects have improved, but also how these improvements align with strategic objectives. By applying mathematical rigor to these calculations, companies can measure the tangible outcomes of their changes in a clear, quantifiable manner.
