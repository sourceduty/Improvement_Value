Title: Irreversible entropy transport enhanced by fermionic superfluidity
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 22 April 2024

Abstract:
The nature of particle and entropy flow between two superfluids is often understood in terms of reversible flow carried by an entropy-free, macroscopic wavefunction. While this wavefunction is responsible for many intriguing properties of superfluids and superconductors, its interplay with excitations in non-equilibrium situations is less understood. Here we observe large concurrent flows of both particles and entropy through a ballistic channel connecting two strongly interacting fermionic superfluids. Both currents respond nonlinearly to chemical potential and temperature biases. We find that the entropy transported per particle is much larger than the prediction of superfluid hydrodynamics in the linear regime and largely independent of changes in the channel’s geometry. By contrast, the timescales of advective and diffusive entropy transport vary significantly with the channel geometry. In our setting, superfluidity counterintuitively increases the speed of entropy transport. Moreover, we develop a phenomenological model describing the nonlinear dynamics within the framework of generalized gradient dynamics. Our approach for measuring entropy currents may help elucidate mechanisms of heat transfer in superfluids and superconducting devices. Connecting two superfluid reservoirs leads to both particle and entropy flow between the systems. Now, a direct measurement of the entropy current and production in ultracold quantum gases reveals how superfluidity enhances entropy transport.

Title: Distinct elastic properties and their origins in glasses and gels
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 12 April 2024

Abstract:
Glasses and gels, common amorphous solids with diverse applications, share intriguing similarities, including rigidity without translational order and dynamic slowing during ageing. However, their various underlying differences have not yet been explained. Here, through simulations, we elucidate distinct elastic properties related to temperature, observation times and ageing in glasses and gels, uncovering the underlying mechanisms. Configurational constraints, characterized by vibrational mean-squared displacements, similarly impact shear and bulk moduli in gels, but uniquely affect the shear modulus in glasses. As glasses age, a persistent trend of stiffening emerges, in contrast to gels, which initially stiffen and subsequently soften. We attribute these differences to mechanisms minimizing free energy: structural ordering in glasses and interface reduction in gels. Our findings not only reveal distinct behaviours but also shed light on the origin and evolution of elasticity in non-equilibrium disordered solids, with implications for amorphous material application and design. As amorphous solids, glasses and gels are similar, but the origins of their different elastic properties are unclear. Simulations now suggest differing free-energy-minimizing pathways: structural ordering for glasses and interface reduction for gels.

Title: Multiphoton electron emission with non-classical light
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 09 April 2024

Abstract:
Photon number distributions of classical and non-classical light sources have been studied extensively, yet their impact on photoemission processes is largely unexplored. In this article, we present measurements of electron number distributions from metal needle tips illuminated with ultrashort light pulses with various photon quantum statistics. By varying the photon statistics of the exciting light field between classical (Poissonian) and quantum (super-Poissonian), we demonstrate that the measured electron distributions are changed substantially. Using single-mode bright squeezed vacuum light, we measure extreme statistics events with up to 65 electrons from one light pulse at a mean of 0.27 electrons per pulse—the likelihood for such an event equals 10−128 with Poissonian statistics. By changing the number of modes of the exciting bright squeezed vacuum, we can tailor the electron number distribution on demand. Most importantly, our results demonstrate that the photon statistics is imprinted from the driving light to the emitted electrons, opening the door to new sensor devices and to strong-field optics with quantum light and electrons. Photoemission experiments demonstrate that the photon number statistics of the exciting light can be imprinted on the emitted electrons, allowing the controlled generation of classical or non-classical electron number statistics of free electrons.

Title: Search for decoherence from quantum gravity with atmospheric neutrinos
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 26 March 2024

Abstract:
Neutrino oscillations at the highest energies and longest baselines can be used to study the structure of spacetime and test the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics. If the metric of spacetime has a quantum mechanical description, its fluctuations at the Planck scale are expected to introduce non-unitary effects that are inconsistent with the standard unitary time evolution of quantum mechanics. Neutrinos interacting with such fluctuations would lose their quantum coherence, deviating from the expected oscillatory flavour composition at long distances and high energies. Here we use atmospheric neutrinos detected by the IceCube South Pole Neutrino Observatory in the energy range of 0.5–10.0 TeV to search for coherence loss in neutrino propagation. We find no evidence of anomalous neutrino decoherence and determine limits on neutrino–quantum gravity interactions. The constraint on the effective decoherence strength parameter within an energy-independent decoherence model improves on previous limits by a factor of 30. For decoherence effects scaling as E2, our limits are advanced by more than six orders of magnitude beyond past measurements compared with the state of the art. Interactions of atmospheric neutrinos with quantum-gravity-induced fluctuations of the metric of spacetime would lead to decoherence. The IceCube Collaboration constrains such interactions with atmospheric neutrinos.

Title: Observation of Josephson harmonics in tunnel junctions
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 14 February 2024

Abstract:
Approaches to developing large-scale superconducting quantum processors must cope with the numerous microscopic degrees of freedom that are ubiquitous in solid-state devices. State-of-the-art superconducting qubits employ aluminium oxide (AlOx) tunnel Josephson junctions as the sources of nonlinearity necessary to perform quantum operations. Analyses of these junctions typically assume an idealized, purely sinusoidal current–phase relation. However, this relation is expected to hold only in the limit of vanishingly low-transparency channels in the AlOx barrier. Here we show that the standard current–phase relation fails to accurately describe the energy spectra of transmon artificial atoms across various samples and laboratories. Instead, a mesoscopic model of tunnelling through an inhomogeneous AlOx barrier predicts percent-level contributions from higher Josephson harmonics. By including these in the transmon Hamiltonian, we obtain orders of magnitude better agreement between the computed and measured energy spectra. The presence and impact of Josephson harmonics has important implications for developing AlOx-based quantum technologies including quantum computers and parametric amplifiers. As an example, we show that engineered Josephson harmonics can reduce the charge dispersion and associated errors in transmon qubits by an order of magnitude while preserving their anharmonicity. The standard current–phase relation in tunnel Josephson junctions involves a single sinusoidal term, but real junctions are more complicated. The effects of higher Josephson harmonics have now been identified in superconducting qubit devices.

Title: Ferroelectric and spontaneous quantum Hall states in intrinsic rhombohedral trilayer graphene
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 16 January 2024

Abstract:
Non-trivial interacting phases can emerge in elementary materials. As a prime example, continuing advances in device quality have facilitated the observation of a variety of spontaneously ordered quantum states in bilayer graphene. Its natural extension, rhombohedral trilayer graphene—in which the layers are stacked in an ABC fashion—is predicted to host stronger electron–electron interactions than bilayer graphene because of its flatter low-energy bands and larger winding number. Theoretically, five spontaneous quantum Hall phases have been proposed to be candidate electronic ground states. Here we observe evidence for four of the five competing ordered states in interaction-maximized, dual-gated, rhombohedral trilayer graphene. In particular, at small magnetic fields, two states with Chern numbers 3 and 6 can be stabilized at elevated and low perpendicular electric fields, respectively, and both exhibit clear magnetic hysteresis. We also show that the quantum Hall ferromagnets of the zero-energy Landau levels are ferroelectrics with spontaneous layer polarizations even at zero electric field, as evidenced by electric hysteresis. Bilayer graphene is known to host states where interactions dominate the electronic behaviour. Now, transport measurements show that this is also true for trilayer graphene and give evidence for ferroelectric states and states with high Chern number.

Title: Heating and cooling are fundamentally asymmetric and evolve along distinct pathways
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 03 January 2024

Abstract:
According to conventional wisdom, a system placed in an environment with a different temperature tends to relax to the temperature of the latter, mediated by the flows of heat or matter that are set solely by the temperature difference. It is becoming clear, however, that thermal relaxation is much more intricate when temperature changes push the system far from thermodynamic equilibrium. Here, by using an optically trapped colloidal particle, we show that microscale systems under such conditions heat up faster than they cool down. We find that between any pair of temperatures, heating is not only faster than cooling but the respective processes, in fact, evolve along fundamentally distinct pathways, which we explain with a new theoretical framework that we call thermal kinematics. Our results change the view of thermalization at the microscale and will have a strong impact on energy-conversion applications and thermal management of microscopic devices, particularly in the operation of Brownian heat engines. Heating and cooling are shown to happen along distinct thermodynamic pathways, which makes the former faster than the latter. This finding calls for a rethink of the fundamentals of thermalization processes at the microscale and of devices like Brownian heat engines.

Title: Overcoming leakage in quantum error correction
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 05 October 2023

Abstract:
The leakage of quantum information out of the two computational states of a qubit into other energy states represents a major challenge for quantum error correction. During the operation of an error-corrected algorithm, leakage builds over time and spreads through multi-qubit interactions. This leads to correlated errors that degrade the exponential suppression of the logical error with scale, thus challenging the feasibility of quantum error correction as a path towards fault-tolerant quantum computation. Here, we demonstrate a distance-3 surface code and distance-21 bit-flip code on a quantum processor for which leakage is removed from all qubits in each cycle. This shortens the lifetime of leakage and curtails its ability to spread and induce correlated errors. We report a tenfold reduction in the steady-state leakage population of the data qubits encoding the logical state and an average leakage population of less than 1 × 10−3 throughout the entire device. Our leakage removal process efficiently returns the system back to the computational basis. Adding it to a code circuit would prevent leakage from inducing correlated error across cycles. With this demonstration that leakage can be contained, we have resolved a key challenge for practical quantum error correction at scale. Physical realizations of qubits are often vulnerable to leakage errors, where the system ends up outside the basis used to store quantum information. A leakage removal protocol can suppress the impact of leakage on quantum error-correcting codes.

Title: Characterizing a non-equilibrium phase transition on a quantum computer
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 11 September 2023

Abstract:
Quantum systems subject to driving and dissipation display distinctive non-equilibrium phenomena relevant to condensed matter, quantum optics, metrology and quantum error correction. An example is the emergence of phase transitions with uniquely quantum properties, which opposes the intuition that dissipation generally leads to classical behaviour. The quantum and non-equilibrium nature of such systems makes them hard to study with existing tools, such as those from equilibrium statistical mechanics, and represents a challenge for numerical simulations. Quantum computers, however, are well suited to simulating such systems, especially as hardware developments enable the controlled application of dissipative operations in a pristine quantum environment. Here we demonstrate a large-scale accurate quantum simulation of a non-equilibrium phase transition using a trapped-ion quantum computer. We simulate a quantum extension of the classical contact process that has been proposed as a description for driven gases of Rydberg atoms and has stimulated numerous attempts to determine the impact of quantum effects on the classical directed-percolation universality class. We use techniques such as qubit reuse and error avoidance based on real-time conditional logic to implement large instances of the model with 73 sites and up to 72 circuit layers and quantitatively determine the model’s critical properties. Our work demonstrates that today’s quantum computers are able to perform useful simulations of open quantum system dynamics and non-equilibrium phase transitions. Quantum computers may help to solve classically intractable problems, such as simulating non-equilibrium dissipative quantum systems. The critical dynamics of a dissipative quantum model has now been probed on a trapped-ion quantum computer.

Title: Quantum advantage in microwave quantum radar
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 29 June 2023

Abstract:
A central goal of any quantum technology consists in demonstrating an advantage in their performance compared to the best possible classical implementation. A quantum radar improves the detection of a target placed in a noisy environment by exploiting quantum correlations between two modes, probe and idler. The predicted quantum enhancement is not only less sensitive to loss than most quantum metrological applications, but it is also supposed to improve with additional noise. Here we demonstrate a superconducting circuit implementing a microwave quantum radar that can provide more than 20% better performance than any possible classical radar. The scheme involves joint measurement of entangled probe and idler microwave photon states after the probe has been reflected from the target and mixed with thermal noise. By storing the idler state in a resonator, we mitigate the detrimental impact of idler loss on the quantum advantage. Measuring the quantum advantage over a wide range of parameters, we find that the purity of the initial probe-idler entangled state is the main limiting factor and needs to be considered in any practical application. Proposals for quantum radars have suggested that in noisy environments there may be a benefit in sensing using quantum microwaves. A superconducting circuit experiment has now confirmed an advantage exists under appropriate conditions.

Title: Anderson localization of electromagnetic waves in three dimensions
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 15 June 2023

Abstract:
Anderson localization is a halt of diffusive wave propagation in disordered systems. Despite extensive studies over the past 40 years, Anderson localization of light in three dimensions has remained elusive, leading to the question of its very existence. Recent advances have enabled finite-difference time-domain calculations to be sped up by orders of magnitude, allowing us to conduct brute-force numerical simulations of light transport in fully disordered three-dimensional systems with unprecedented dimension and refractive index difference. We show numerically three-dimensional localization of vector electromagnetic waves in random aggregates of overlapping metallic spheres, in sharp contrast to the absence of localization for dielectric spheres with a refractive index up to 10 in air. Our work opens a wide range of avenues in both fundamental research related to Anderson localization and potential applications using three-dimensional localized light. Whether Anderson localization of light can be achieved in three dimensions has remained an open question. Numerical calculations now show that it is possible with a random arrangement of metallic spheres, but not with dielectric ones.

Title: Direct manipulation of a superconducting spin qubit strongly coupled to a transmon qubit
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 22 May 2023

Abstract:
Spin qubits in semiconductors are a promising platform for producing highly scalable quantum computing devices. However, it is difficult to realize multiqubit interactions over extended distances. Superconducting spin qubits provide an alternative by encoding a qubit in the spin degree of freedom of an Andreev level. These Andreev spin qubits have an intrinsic spin–supercurrent coupling that enables the use of recent advances in circuit quantum electrodynamics. The first realization of an Andreev spin qubit encoded the qubit in the excited states of a semiconducting weak link, leading to frequent decay out of the computational subspace. Additionally, rapid qubit manipulation was hindered by the need for indirect Raman transitions. Here we use an electrostatically defined quantum dot Josephson junction with large charging energy, which leads to a spin-split doublet ground state. We tune the qubit frequency over a frequency range of 10 GHz using a magnetic field, which also enables us to investigate the qubit performance using direct spin manipulation. An all-electric microwave drive produces Rabi frequencies exceeding 200 MHz. We embed the Andreev spin qubit in a superconducting transmon qubit, demonstrating strong coherent qubit–qubit coupling. These results are a crucial step towards a hybrid architecture that combines the beneficial aspects of both superconducting and semiconductor qubits. Semiconductor qubits can benefit from existing industrial methods, but there are challenges in coupling qubits together. A hybrid superconductor–semiconductor qubit that couples to superconducting qubit devices may overcome these issues.

Title: Probabilistic error cancellation with sparse Pauli–Lindblad models on noisy quantum processors
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 08 May 2023

Abstract:
Noise in quantum computers can result in biased estimates of physical observables. Accurate bias-free estimates can be obtained using probabilistic error cancellation, an error-mitigation technique that effectively inverts well-characterized noise channels. Learning correlated noise channels in large quantum circuits, however, has been a major challenge and has severely hampered experimental realizations. Our work presents a practical protocol for learning and inverting a sparse noise model that is able to capture correlated noise and scales to large quantum devices. These advances allow us to demonstrate probabilistic error cancellation on a superconducting quantum processor, thereby providing a way to measure noise-free observables at larger circuit volumes. Probabilistic error cancellation could improve the performance of quantum computers without the prohibitive overhead of fault-tolerant error correction. The method has now been demonstrated on a device with 20 qubits.

Title: Mesoscopic Klein-Schwinger effect in graphene
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 09 March 2023

Abstract:
Strong electric field annihilation by particle–antiparticle pair creation, also known as the Schwinger effect, is a non-perturbative prediction of quantum electrodynamics. Its experimental demonstration remains elusive, as threshold electric fields are extremely strong and beyond current reach. Here, we propose a mesoscopic variant of the Schwinger effect in graphene, which hosts Dirac fermions with an approximate electron–hole symmetry. Using transport measurements, we report on universal one-dimensional Schwinger conductance at the pinchoff of ballistic graphene transistors. Strong pinchoff electric fields are concentrated within approximately 1 μm of the transistor’s drain and induce Schwinger electron–hole pair creation at saturation. This effect precedes a collective instability towards an ohmic Zener regime, which is rejected at twice the pinchoff voltage in long devices. These observations advance our understanding of current saturation limits in ballistic graphene and provide a direction for further quantum electrodynamic experiments in the laboratory. Observations of the Schwinger effect—the creation of matter by electric fields—have been hindered by the high required field strength. A mesoscopic variant of the Schwinger effect has now been realized in graphene transistors.

Title: Scalable error mitigation for noisy quantum circuits produces competitive expectation values
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 06 February 2023

Abstract:
Noise in existing quantum processors only enables an approximation to ideal quantum computation. However, for the computation of expectation values, these approximations can be improved by error mitigation. This has been experimentally demonstrated in small systems but the scaling of these methods to larger circuit volumes remains unknown. Here we demonstrate the utility of zero-noise extrapolation for practically relevant quantum circuits using up to 26 qubits, circuit depths of 120 and 1,080 CNOT gates. We study the scaling of the method for canonical examples of product states and entangling Clifford circuits of increasing size, and extend it to simulating the quench dynamics of two-dimensional Ising spin lattices with varying couplings. These experiments reveal that the accuracy of physically relevant observables after error mitigation substantially exceeds previously expected values. Furthermore, we show that the efficacy of error mitigation is greatly enhanced by additional error suppression techniques and native gate decomposition that reduce the circuit time. By combining these methods, the accuracy of our quantum simulation surpasses the classical approximations obtained from an established tensor network method. These results establish the potential of a useful quantum advantage using noisy, digital quantum processors. A technique called error mitigation can significantly improve the performance of large-scale quantum computations on near-term devices without the significant resource overheard of fault-tolerant quantum error correction.

Title: Calorimetry of a phase slip in a Josephson junction
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 05 January 2023

Abstract:
Josephson junctions are a central element in superconducting quantum technology; in these devices, irreversibility arises from abrupt slips of the quantum phase difference across the junction. This phase slip is often visualized as the tunnelling of a flux quantum in the transverse direction to the superconducting weak link, which produces dissipation. Here we detect the instantaneous heat release caused by a phase slip in a Josephson junction, signalled by an abrupt increase in the local electronic temperature in the weak link and subsequent relaxation back to equilibrium. Beyond the advance in experimental quantum thermodynamics of observing heat in an elementary quantum process, our approach could allow experimentally investigating the ubiquity of dissipation in quantum devices, particularly in superconducting quantum sensors and qubits. Superconducting currents around a loop containing a weak link can be quantized and only change during discrete events called phase slips. Now, the heat generated by a single phase slip and the subsequent relaxation have been experimentally observed.

Title: Floquet engineering of strongly driven excitons in monolayer tungsten disulfide
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 05 January 2023

Abstract:
Interactions of quantum materials with strong laser fields can induce exotic non-equilibrium electronic states1–6. Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides, a new class of direct-gap semiconductors with prominent quantum confinement7, offer exceptional opportunities for the Floquet engineering of excitons, which are quasiparticle electron–hole correlated states8. Strong-field driving has the potential to achieve enhanced control of the electronic band structure and thus the possibility of opening a new realm of exciton light–matter interactions. However, a full characterization of strong-field driven exciton dynamics4,9 has been difficult. Here we use mid-infrared laser pulses below the optical bandgap to excite monolayer tungsten disulfide and demonstrate strong-field light dressing of excitons in excess of a hundred millielectronvolts. Our high-sensitivity transient absorption spectroscopy further reveals the formation of a virtual absorption feature below the 1s-exciton resonance, which we assign to a light-dressed sideband from the dark 2p-exciton state. Quantum-mechanical simulations substantiate the experimental results and enable us to retrieve real-space movies of the exciton dynamics. This study advances our understanding of the exciton dynamics in the strong-field regime, showing the possibility of harnessing ultrafast, strong-field phenomena in device applications of two-dimensional materials. The interaction of strong laser fields with tungsten disulfide leads to light-dressed Floquet replica of excitonic states, which manifest as new features in the transient absorption spectrum.

Title: Mechanical stress driven by rigidity sensing governs epithelial stability
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 28 November 2022

Abstract:
Epithelia act as barriers against environmental stresses. They are continuously exposed to various mechanical stress and abrasion, which impact epithelial integrity. The impact of the environment on epithelial integrity remains elusive. By culturing epithelial cells on two-dimensional hydrogels, we observe a loss of epithelial monolayer integrity on soft substrates through spontaneous hole formation. These monolayer ruptures are associated with local cellular stretching and cell-division events. Substrate stiffness triggers an unanticipated mechanical switch of epithelial monolayers from compressive stress on stiff substrates to highly tensile on soft, favouring hole formation. In agreement with an active nematic model, hole-opening events occur preferentially near spontaneous half-integer topological defects, which underpin large isotropic stress fluctuations triggering stochastic mechanical failure. Our results thus show that substrate stiffness provides feedback on the mechanical state of epithelial monolayers with potential application towards a mechanistic understanding of compromised epithelial integrity during normal and pathological human ontogenesis. On soft substrates, epithelial tissues are under high tension and form holes that spontaneously heal. Thus, mechanical stress directly impacts the integrity of epithelia.

Title: Dynamical photon–photon interaction mediated by a quantum emitter
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 01 September 2022

Abstract:
Single photons role in the development of quantum science and technology. They can carry quantum information over extended distances to act as the backbone of a future quantum internet1 and can be manipulated in advanced photonic circuits, enabling scalable photonic quantum computing2,3. However, more sophisticated devices and protocols need access to multi-photon states with particular forms of entanglement. Efficient light–matter interfaces offer a route to reliably generating these entangled resource states4,5. Here we utilize the efficient and coherent coupling of a single quantum emitter to a nanophotonic waveguide to realize a quantum nonlinear interaction between single-photon wavepackets. We demonstrate the control of a photon using a second photon mediated by the quantum emitter. The dynamical response of the two-photon interaction is experimentally unravelled and reveals quantum correlations controlled by the pulse duration. Further development of this platform work, which constitutes a new research frontier in quantum optics6, will enable the tailoring of complex photonic quantum resource states. Efficient interactions between two photons is a challenging requirement for quantum information processing. A quantum dot coupled to a waveguide produces strong interactions that can induce photon correlations and reshape two-photon wavepackets.

Title: Coherence enhancement of solid-state qubits by local manipulation of the electron spin bath
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 25 August 2022

Abstract:
The performance of qubit-based technologies can be strongly limited by environmental sources of noise and disorder that cause decoherence. Qubits used in quantum sensing are usually very close to the host surface to enhance their coupling to external targets. This leaves them vulnerable to the effects of the surrounding noisy electron spin bath near the surface, which is very challenging to eliminate. Here we developed an efficient method to engineer the immediate electrostatic environment of nitrogen vacancy centre qubits located several nanometres beneath the diamond surface. We adopt a ‘pull-and-push’ strategy for near-surface charge manipulation using the strong local electric field of an atomic force microscope tip. Our technique is particularly effective for extremely shallow nitrogen vacancy centres, increasing their spin echo time by up to 20 fold. This corresponds to an 80-fold enhancement in the potential sensitivity for detecting individual external proton spins. Our work not only represents a step towards overcoming a fundamental restriction to applications of shallow nitrogen vacancy centres for quantum sensing but may also provide a general route for enhancing the coherence of solid-state qubits. Nitrogen vacancy centres close to the surface of diamonds are a key component of quantum sensing technologies. Using an atomic force microscope to manipulate the surface electrostatic environment can significantly improve the sensing performance.

Title: Ab initio predictions link the neutron skin of 208Pb to nuclear forces
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 22 August 2022

Abstract:
Heavy atomic nuclei have an excess of neutrons over protons, which leads to the formation of a neutron skin whose thickness is sensitive to details of the nuclear force. This links atomic nuclei to properties of neutron stars, thereby relating objects that differ in size by orders of magnitude. The nucleus 208Pb is of particular interest because it exhibits a simple structure and is experimentally accessible. However, computing such a heavy nucleus has been out of reach for ab initio theory. By combining advances in quantum many-body methods, statistical tools and emulator technology, we make quantitative predictions for the properties of 208Pb starting from nuclear forces that are consistent with symmetries of low-energy quantum chromodynamics. We explore 109 different nuclear force parameterizations via history matching, confront them with data in select light nuclei and arrive at an importance-weighted ensemble of interactions. We accurately reproduce bulk properties of 208Pb and determine the neutron skin thickness, which is smaller and more precise than a recent extraction from parity-violating electron scattering but in agreement with other experimental probes. This work demonstrates how realistic two- and three-nucleon forces act in a heavy nucleus and allows us to make quantitative predictions across the nuclear landscape. Predictions of the properties of 208Pb from first principles augmented by statistical learning techniques reproduce those seen in experiments but rule out very thick neutron skins.

Title: Time-reversal-based quantum metrology with many-body entangled states
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 14 July 2022

Abstract:
Linear quantum measurements with independent particles are bounded by the standard quantum limit, which limits the precision achievable in estimating unknown phase parameters. The standard quantum limit can be overcome by entangling the particles, but the sensitivity is often limited by the final state readout, especially for complex entangled many-body states with non-Gaussian probability distributions. Here, by implementing an effective time-reversal protocol in an optically engineered many-body spin Hamiltonian, we demonstrate a quantum measurement with non-Gaussian states with performance beyond the limit of the readout scheme. This signal amplification through a time-reversed interaction achieves the greatest phase sensitivity improvement beyond the standard quantum limit demonstrated to date in any full Ramsey interferometer. These results open the field of robust time-reversal-based measurement protocols offering precision not too far from the Heisenberg limit. Potential applications include quantum sensors that operate at finite bandwidth, and the principle we demonstrate may also advance areas such as quantum engineering, quantum measurements and the search for new physics using optical-transition atomic clocks. The standard quantum limit bounds the precision of quantum measurements. Now, a protocol based on time-reversal operations with cold atoms overcomes that limit and achieves the greatest phase sensitivity improvement in any full Ramsey interferometer.

Title: Non-classical mechanical states guided in a phononic waveguide
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 23 May 2022

Abstract:
The ability to create, manipulate and detect non-classical states of light has been key for many recent achievements in quantum physics and for developing quantum technologies. Achieving the same level of control over phonons, the quanta of vibrations, could have a similar impact, in particular on the fields of quantum sensing and quantum information processing. Here we present a crucial step towards this level of control and realize a single-mode waveguide for individual phonons in a suspended silicon microstructure. We use a cavity–waveguide architecture, where the cavity is used as a source and detector for the mechanical excitations while the waveguide has a free-standing end to reflect the phonons. This enables us to observe multiple round trips of phonons between the source and the reflector. The long mechanical lifetime of almost 100 μs demonstrates the possibility of nearly lossless transmission of single phonons over, in principle, tens of centimetres. Our experiment demonstrates full on-chip control over travelling single phonons strongly confined in the directions transverse to the propagation axis, potentially enabling a time-encoded multimode quantum memory at telecommunications wavelength and advanced quantum acoustics experiments. Non-classical vibrations are generated and transmitted along a mechanical waveguide, providing a platform for distributing quantum information and realizing hybrid quantum devices using phonons in a solid-state system.

Title: Spontaneous charging affects the motion of sliding drops
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 14 April 2022

Abstract:
Water drops moving on surfaces are not only an everyday phenomenon seen on windows but also form an essential part of many industrial processes. Previous understanding is that drop motion is dictated by viscous dissipation and activated dynamics at the contact line. Here we demonstrate that these two effects cannot fully explain the complex paths of sliding or impacting drops. To accurately determine the forces experienced by moving drops, we imaged their trajectory when sliding down a tilted surface, and applied the relevant equations of motion. We found that drop motion on low-permittivity substrates is substantially influenced by electrostatic forces. Our findings confirm that electrostatics must be taken into consideration for the description of the motion of water, aqueous electrolytes and ethylene glycol on hydrophobic surfaces. Our results are relevant for improving the control of drop motion in many applications, including printing, microfluidics, water management and triboelectric nanogenerators. The sliding of a water drop on a surface is traditionally described by taking flow within the drop and contact-line friction into account. Now, evidence shows that electric forces can also substantially affect water-on-surface sliding dynamics.

Abstract:
Nanophotonic cavities with Kerr nonlinearities are a versatile platform both to explore fundamental physics and to develop practical photonic technologies1–3. This is possible because nanoscale structures allow precise dispersion control and provide significant field enhancement. To improve the functionality and performance of photonic devices even further, direct control of the Kerr nonlinearity would be desirable. Here, we report the in situ control of integrated Kerr nonlinearity through its interplay with the cascaded second-order nonlinear process4–9. We observe a Fano resonance in the nonlinear spectrum rather than in the linear transmission10, confirming the quantum interference between competing optical nonlinear pathways. The Kerr nonlinearity is tuned over a dynamic range of 10 dB without modifying the photonic structure. We also demonstrate the suppression of the intrinsic material nonlinearity and we use the tunable nonlinearity to control the spectral brightness and coincidence-to-accidental ratio of single-photon generation. Many nanophotonic devices rely on optical nonlinearities, which can be indirectly engineered. The quantum interference of different nonlinear pathways directly controls the Kerr nonlinearity without changing the device design.

Title: Depth-targeted energy delivery deep inside scattering media
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 27 January 2022

Abstract:
Diffusion makes it difficult to predict and control wave transport through a medium. Overcoming wave diffusion to deliver energy into a target region deep inside a diffusive system is an important challenge for applications, but also represents an interesting fundamental question. It is known that coherently controlling the incident wavefront allows diffraction-limited focusing inside a diffusive system, but in many applications, the targets are significantly larger than a focus and the maximum deliverable energy remains unknown. Here we introduce the ‘deposition matrix’, which maps an input wavefront to the internal field distribution, and we theoretically predict the ultimate limit on energy enhancement at any depth. Additionally, we find that the maximum obtainable energy enhancement occurs at three-fourths the thickness of the diffusive system, regardless of its scattering strength. We experimentally verify our predictions by measuring the deposition matrix in two-dimensional diffusive waveguides. The experiment gives direct access to the internal field distribution from the third dimension, and we can excite the eigenstates to enhance or suppress the energy within an extended target region. Our analysis reveals that such enhancement or suppression results from both selective transmission-eigenchannel excitation and constructive or destructive interference among these channels. Optimally depositing optical energy into an extended region of a diffusive medium, such as biological tissue, is a challenging task. A matrix that maps the incoming wavefront to the field distribution inside the material can predict the energy enhancement that occurs at a given depth.

Title: Design of inertial fusion implosions reaching the burning plasma regime
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 26 January 2022

Abstract:
In a burning plasma state1–7, alpha particles from deuterium–tritium fusion reactions redeposit their energy and are the dominant source of heating. This state has recently been achieved at the US National Ignition Facility8 using indirect-drive inertial-confinement fusion. Our experiments use a laser-generated radiation-filled cavity (a hohlraum) to spherically implode capsules containing deuterium and tritium fuel in a central hot spot where the fusion reactions occur. We have developed more efficient hohlraums to implode larger fusion targets compared with previous experiments9,10. This delivered more energy to the hot spot, whereas other parameters were optimized to maintain the high pressures required for inertial-confinement fusion. We also report improvements in implosion symmetry control by moving energy between the laser beams11–16 and designing advanced hohlraum geometry17 that allows for these larger implosions to be driven at the present laser energy and power capability of the National Ignition Facility. These design changes resulted in fusion powers of 1.5 petawatts, greater than the input power of the laser, and 170 kJ of fusion energy18,19. Radiation hydrodynamics simulations20,21 show energy deposition by alpha particles as the dominant term in the hot-spot energy balance, indicative of a burning plasma state. In burning plasma, alpha particles from fusion reactions are the dominant source of heating. The design choices that resulted in reaching this state in experiments at the National Ignition Facility are reported.

Title: Resolving catastrophic error bursts from cosmic rays in large arrays of superconducting qubits
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 13 December 2021

Abstract:
Scalable quantum computing can become a reality with error correction, provided that coherent qubits can be constructed in large arrays1,2. The key premise is that physical errors can remain both small and sufficiently uncorrelated as devices scale, so that logical error rates can be exponentially suppressed. However, impacts from cosmic rays and latent radioactivity violate these assumptions. An impinging particle can ionize the substrate and induce a burst of quasiparticles that destroys qubit coherence throughout the device. High-energy radiation has been identified as a source of error in pilot superconducting quantum devices3–5, but the effect on large-scale algorithms and error correction remains an open question. Elucidating the physics involved requires operating large numbers of qubits at the same rapid timescales necessary for error correction. Here, we use space- and time-resolved measurements of a large-scale quantum processor to identify bursts of quasiparticles produced by high-energy rays. We track the events from their initial localized impact as they spread, simultaneously and severely limiting the energy coherence of all qubits and causing chip-wide failure. Our results provide direct insights into the impact of these damaging error bursts and highlight the necessity of mitigation to enable quantum computing to scale. Cosmic rays flying through superconducting quantum devices create bursts of excitations that destroy qubit coherence. Rapid, spatially resolved measurements of qubit error rates make it possible to observe the evolution of the bursts across a chip.

Title: Quantum coherent spin–electric control in a molecular nanomagnet at clock transitions
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 14 October 2021

Abstract:
Electrical control of spins at the nanoscale offers significant architectural advantages in spintronics, because electric fields can be confined over shorter length scales than magnetic fields1–5. Thus, recent demonstrations of electric-field sensitivities in molecular spin materials6–8 are tantalizing, raising the viability of the quantum analogues of macroscopic magneto-electric devices9–15. However, the electric-field sensitivities reported so far are rather weak, prompting the question of how to design molecules with stronger spin–electric couplings. Here we show that one path is to identify an energy scale in the spin spectrum that is associated with a structural degree of freedom with a substantial electrical polarizability. We study an example of a molecular nanomagnet in which a small structural distortion establishes clock transitions (that is, transitions whose energy is to first order independent of the magnetic field) in the spin spectrum; the fact that this distortion is associated with an electric dipole allows us to control the clock-transition energy to an unprecedented degree. We demonstrate coherent electrical control of the quantum spin state and exploit it to independently manipulate the two magnetically identical but inversion-related molecules in the unit cell of the crystal. Our findings pave the way for the use of molecular spins in quantum technologies and spintronics. Through chemical design, the spins in molecular nanomagnets may be used as electrically tunable qubits. Electrical control of molecular distortion enables manipulation of the quantum spin state while suppressing decoherence from magnetic fields.

Title: Mass measurements of 99–101In challenge ab initio nuclear theory of the nuclide 100Sn
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 23 September 2021

Abstract:
The tin isotope 100Sn is of singular interest for nuclear structure due to its closed-shell proton and neutron configurations. It is also the heaviest nucleus comprising protons and neutrons in equal numbers—a feature that enhances the contribution of the short-range proton–neutron pairing interaction and strongly influences its decay via the weak interaction. Decay studies in the region of 100Sn have attempted to prove its doubly magic character1 but few have studied it from an ab initio theoretical perspective2,3, and none of these has addressed the odd-proton neighbours, which are inherently more difficult to describe but crucial for a complete test of nuclear forces. Here we present direct mass measurements of the exotic odd-proton nuclide 100In, the beta-decay daughter of 100Sn, and of 99In, with one proton less than 100Sn. We use advanced mass spectrometry techniques to measure 99In, which is produced at a rate of only a few ions per second, and to resolve the ground and isomeric states in 101In. The experimental results are compared with ab initio many-body calculations. The 100-fold improvement in precision of the 100In mass value highlights a discrepancy in the atomic-mass values of 100Sn deduced from recent beta-decay results4,5. Accurate mass measurements of the indium isotopes adjacent to the doubly magic 100Sn provide critical benchmarks for ab initio theory, which withstands the challenge.

Title: Tuning of dipolar interactions and evaporative cooling in a three-dimensional molecular quantum gas
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 02 September 2021

Abstract:
Ultracold polar molecules possess long-range, anisotropic and tunable dipolar interactions, providing opportunities to probe quantum phenomena that are inaccessible with existing cold gas platforms. However, experimental progress has been hindered by the dominance of two-body loss over elastic interactions, which prevents efficient evaporative cooling. Although recent work has demonstrated controlled interactions by confining molecules to a two-dimensional geometry, a general approach for tuning molecular interactions in a three-dimensional stable system has been lacking. Here we demonstrate tunable elastic dipolar interactions in a bulk gas of ultracold 40K87Rb molecules in three dimensions, facilitated by an electric field-induced shielding resonance that suppresses the reactive loss by a factor of 30. This improvement in the ratio of elastic to inelastic collisions enables direct thermalization. The thermalization rate depends on the angle between the collisional axis and the dipole orientation controlled by an external electric field, a direct manifestation of the anisotropic dipolar interaction. We achieve evaporative cooling mediated by the dipolar interactions in three dimensions. This work demonstrates full control of a long-lived bulk quantum gas system with tunable long-range interactions, paving the way for the study of collective quantum many-body physics. Realizing the potential of dipolar molecular gases to explore quantum physics needs elastic, tunable interactions and low temperatures. This is now possible due to advances in control that suppress molecular losses and enable efficient cooling.

Title: Topological frequency combs and nested temporal solitons
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 05 August 2021

Abstract:
Recent advances in realizing optical frequency combs using nonlinear parametric processes in integrated photonic resonators have revolutionized on-chip optical clocks, spectroscopy and multichannel optical communications. At the same time, the introduction of topological physics in photonic systems has allowed the design of photonic devices with novel functionalities and inherent robustness against fabrication disorders. Here we use topological design principles to theoretically propose the generation of optical frequency combs and temporal dissipative Kerr solitons in a two-dimensional array of coupled ring resonators that creates a synthetic magnetic field for photons and exhibits topological edge states. We show that these topological edge states constitute a travelling-wave super-ring resonator that leads to the generation of coherent nested optical frequency combs, as well as the self-formation of nested temporal solitons and Turing rolls that are remarkably phase-locked over more than 40 rings. Moreover, we show that the topological nested solitons are robust against defects in the lattice, and a single nested soliton achieves a mode efficiency of over 50%, an order of magnitude higher than single-ring frequency combs. Our topological frequency comb works in a parameter regime that can be readily accessed using existing low-loss integrated photonic platforms like silicon nitride. Optical frequency combs are a key technology in precision time keeping, spectroscopy and metrology. A theoretical proposal shows that introducing topological principles into their design makes on-chip combs more efficient and robust against fabrication defects.

Title: Nonlinear second-order photonic topological insulators
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 01 July 2021

Abstract:
Higher-order topological insulators are a novel topological phase beyond the framework of conventional bulk–boundary correspondence1,2. In these peculiar systems, the topologically non-trivial boundary modes are characterized by a co-dimension of at least two3,4. Despite several promising preliminary considerations regarding the impact of nonlinearity in such systems5,6, the flourishing field of experimental higher-order topological insulator research has thus far been confined to the linear evolution of topological states. As such, the observation of the interplay between nonlinearity and the dynamics of higher-order topological phases in conservative systems remains elusive. Here we experimentally demonstrate nonlinear higher-order topological corner states. Our photonic platform enables us to observe nonlinear topological corner states as well as the formation of solitons in such topological structures. Our work paves the way towards the exploration of topological properties of matter in the nonlinear regime, and may herald a new class of compact devices that harnesses the intriguing features of topology in an on-demand fashion. The nonlinear properties of photonic topological insulators remain largely unexplored, as band topology is linked to linear systems. But nonlinear topological corner states and solitons can form in a second-order topological insulator, as shown by experiments.

Title: Absolute 13C/12C isotope amount ratio for Vienna PeeDee Belemnite from infrared absorption spectroscopy
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 26 April 2021

Abstract:
Measurements of isotope ratios are predominantly made with reference to standard specimens that have been characterized in the past. In the 1950s, the carbon isotope ratio was referenced to a belemnite sample collected by Heinz Lowenstam and Harold Urey1 in South Carolina’s PeeDee region. Due to exhaustion of the sample since then, reference materials that are traceable to the original artefact are used to define the Vienna PeeDee Belemnite scale for stable carbon isotope analysis2. However, these reference materials have also become exhausted or proven to exhibit unstable composition over time3, mirroring issues with the international prototype of the kilogram that led to a revised International System of Units4. A campaign to elucidate the stable carbon isotope ratio of Vienna PeeDee Belemnite is underway5, but independent measurement techniques are required to support it. Here we report an accurate value for the stable carbon isotope ratio inferred from infrared absorption spectroscopy, fulfilling the promise of this fundamentally accurate approach6. Our results agree with a value recently derived from mass spectrometry5 and therefore advance the prospects of International System of Units–traceable isotope analysis. Further, our calibration-free method could improve mass balance calculations and enhance isotopic tracer studies in carbon dioxide source apportionment. Isotope ratio measurements are complicated by the instabilities of composition in reference samples. Now a calibration-free method relying on infrared spectroscopy provides measurements that are traceable to International System of Units standards.

Title: One-dimensional Kronig–Penney superlattices at the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 15 April 2021

Abstract:
Semiconductor heterostructures1 and ultracold neutral atomic lattices2 capture many of the essential properties of one-dimensional electronic systems. However, fully one-dimensional superlattices are highly challenging to fabricate in the solid state due to the inherently small length scales involved. Conductive atomic force microscope lithography applied to an oxide interface can create ballistic few-mode electron waveguides with highly quantized conductance and strongly attractive electron–electron interactions3. Here we show that artificial Kronig–Penney-like superlattice potentials can be imposed on such waveguides, introducing a new superlattice spacing that can be made comparable to the mean separation between electrons. The imposed superlattice potential fractures the electronic subbands into a manifold of new subbands with magnetically tunable fractional conductance. The lowest plateau, associated with ballistic transport of spin-singlet electron pairs3, shows enhanced electron pairing, in some cases up to the highest magnetic fields explored. A one-dimensional model of the system suggests that an engineered spin–orbit interaction in the superlattice contributes to the enhanced pairing observed in the devices. These findings are an advance in the ability to design new families of quantum materials with emergent properties and the development of solid-state one-dimensional quantum simulation platforms. The two-dimensional electron gas at an oxide interface is patterned to form a channel with a periodic potential imposed on top. This replicates the textbook Kronig–Penney model and leads to fractionalization of electron bands in the channel.

Title: Solar flare effects in the Earth’s magnetosphere
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 22 March 2021

Abstract:
The Earth’s magnetosphere is the outermost layer of the geospace system deflecting energetic charged particles from the Sun and solar wind. The solar wind has major impacts on the Earth’s magnetosphere, but it is unclear whether the same holds for solar flares—a sudden eruption of electromagnetic radiation on the Sun. Here we use a recently developed whole geospace model combined with observational data from the 6 September 2017 X9.3 solar flare event to reveal solar flare effects on magnetospheric dynamics and on the electrodynamic coupling between the magnetosphere and its adjacent ionosphere, the ionized part of Earth’s upper atmosphere. We observe a rapid and large increase in flare-induced photoionization of the polar ionospheric E-region at altitudes between 90 km and 150 km. This reduces the efficiency of mechanical energy conversion in the dayside solar wind–magnetosphere interaction, resulting in less Joule heating of the Earth’s upper atmosphere, a reconfiguration of magnetosphere convection, as well as changes in dayside and nightside auroral precipitation. This work thus demonstrates that solar flare effects extend throughout the geospace via electrodynamic coupling, and are not limited—as previously believed—to the atmospheric region where radiation energy is absorbed1. The solar wind affects the magnetosphere, but whether this holds true for solar flares was unclear. By combining geospace modelling with observations, solar flares are shown to influence the dynamics of the magnetosphere and its ionosphere coupling.

Title: High-throughput injection–acceleration of electron bunches from a linear accelerator to a laser wakefield accelerator
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 18 March 2021

Abstract:
Plasma-based accelerators driven by either intense lasers1 or charged particle beams2 can accelerate electrons or positrons with extremely high gradients compared with conventional radio-frequency accelerators. For their use as next-generation light sources and in energy frontier colliders3, beams with good stability, high quality, controllable polarization and excellent reproducibility4,5 are required. The accelerated electrons can be either internally injected directly from the background plasma or externally injected from conventional accelerators. Despite significant progress6–14, the beam properties obtained with the internal injection scheme fall short of simultaneously reaching these requirements. In contrast, such high-property beams are routinely generated from conventional accelerators. Therefore, it is important to demonstrate the injection from a conventional accelerator into a plasma-based machine followed by further acceleration of the beam. Here we report the demonstration of external injection from a conventional linear accelerator into a laser wakefield accelerator and subsequent acceleration without any significant loss of charge, which is achieved by properly shaping and matching the beam into the plasma structure. The experimental results, combined with three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, indicate that this is possible with modest degradation in the beam quality. This work is an important step towards realizing a high-throughput, multistage, high-energy, hybrid conventional-plasma-based accelerator. Previously, injections from a conventional accelerator into a plasma-based one suffered from low coupling efficiencies. Now electron bunches are injected with an efficiency of nearly 100% into a laser wakefield accelerator without loss of charge.

Title: Nanoscale mechanics of antiferromagnetic domain walls
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 15 February 2021

Abstract:
Antiferromagnets can encode information in their ordered magnetic structure, providing the basis for future spintronic devices1–3. The control and understanding of antiferromagnetic domain walls, which are the interfaces between domains with differing order parameter orientations, are key ingredients for advancing antiferromagnetic spintronic technologies. However, studies of the intrinsic mechanics of individual antiferromagnetic domain walls are difficult because they require sufficiently pure materials and suitable experimental approaches to address domain walls on the nanoscale. Here we nucleate isolated 180° domain walls in a single crystal of Cr2O3, a prototypical collinear magnetoelectric antiferromagnet, and study their interaction with topographic features fabricated on the sample. We demonstrate domain wall manipulation through the resulting engineered energy landscape and show that the observed interaction is governed by the surface energy of the domain wall. We propose a topographically defined memory architecture based on antiferromagnetic domain walls. Our results advance the understanding of domain wall mechanics in antiferromagnets. High-resolution magnetometry shows that the shape of domain walls in Cr2O3 is determined by the energetic cost of their surface area. The walls behave like elastic surfaces that avoid thicker parts of the sample where they would need to be larger.

Title: Quantum diffusion of microcavity solitons
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 25 January 2021

Abstract:
Coherently pumped (Kerr) solitons in an ideal optical microcavity are expected to undergo random quantum motion that determines fundamental performance limits in applications of the soliton microcombs1. Here this random walk and its impact on Kerr soliton timing jitter are studied experimentally. The quantum limit is discerned by measuring the relative position of counter-propagating solitons2. Their relative motion features weak interactions and also presents common-mode suppression of technical noise, which typically hides the quantum fluctuations. This is in contrast to co-propagating solitons, which are found to have relative timing jitter well below the quantum limit of a single soliton on account of strong correlation of their mutual motion. Good agreement is found between theory and experiment. The results establish the fundamental limits to timing jitter in soliton microcombs and provide new insights on multisoliton physics. Quantum jitter fundamentally limits the performance of microresonator frequency combs. The timing jitter of the solitons that generate the comb spectra is analysed, reaching the quantum limit and establishing fundamental limits for soliton microcombs.

Title: Maximum information states for coherent scattering measurements
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 21 January 2021

Abstract:
The use of coherent light for precision measurements has been a key driving force for numerous research directions, ranging from biomedical optics1,2 to semiconductor manufacturing3. Recent work demonstrates that the precision of such measurements can be substantially improved by tailoring the spatial profile of light fields used for estimating an observable system parameter4–10. These advances naturally raise the intriguing question of which states of light can provide the ultimate measurement precision11. Here we introduce a general approach to determine the optimal coherent states of light for estimating any given parameter, regardless of the complexity of the system. Our analysis reveals that the light fields delivering the ultimate measurement precision are eigenstates of a Hermitian operator that quantifies the Fisher information from the system’s scattering matrix12. To illustrate this concept, we experimentally show that these maximum information states can probe the phase or the position of an object that is hidden by a disordered medium with a precision improved by an order of magnitude compared with unoptimized states. Our results enable optimally precise measurements in arbitrarily complex systems, thus establishing a new benchmark for metrology and imaging applications3,13. Wavefront shaping can reduce uncertainties due to measurement noise through disordered media—key to many imaging applications. Optimal precision can be achieved using light fields that are eigenstates of an operator related to the medium’s scattering matrix.

Title: Energy spread minimization in a beam-driven plasma wakefield accelerator
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 04 January 2021

Abstract:
Next-generation plasma-based accelerators can push electron bunches to gigaelectronvolt energies within centimetre distances1,2. The plasma, excited by a driver pulse, generates large electric fields that can efficiently accelerate a trailing witness bunch3–5, enabling the realization of laboratory-scale applications ranging from high-energy colliders6 to ultrabright light sources7. So far, several experiments have demonstrated large accelerations8–10 but the resulting beam quality, particularly the energy spread, is still far from state-of-the-art conventional accelerators. Here we show the results of a beam-driven plasma acceleration experiment where we used an electron bunch as a driver followed by an ultrashort witness bunch. By setting a positive energy chirp on the witness bunch, its longitudinal phase space is rotated during acceleration, resulting in an ultralow energy spread that is even lower than the spread at the plasma entrance. This result will significantly impact the optimization of the plasma acceleration process and its implementation in forthcoming compact machines for user-oriented applications. In a beam-driven plasma wakefield accelerator, the energy spread of an electron bunch is reduced with respect to the plasma entrance, which is achieved through setting a positive energy chirp that rotates the bunches’ longitudinal phase space.

Title: Binary icosahedral clusters of hard spheres in spherical confinement
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 31 August 2020

Abstract:
The influence of geometry on the local and global packing of particles is important to many fundamental and applied research themes, such as the structure and stability of liquids, crystals and glasses. Here we show by experiments and simulations that a binary mixture of hard-sphere-like nanoparticles crystallizing into a MgZn2 Laves phase in bulk spontaneously forms icosahedral clusters in slowly drying droplets. Using advanced electron tomography, we are able to obtain the real-space coordinates of all the spheres in the icosahedral clusters of up to about 10,000 particles. The local structure of 70–80% of the particles became similar to that of the MgCu2 Laves phase. These observations are important for photonic applications. In addition, we observed in simulations that the icosahedral clusters nucleated away from the spherical boundary, which is distinctly different from that of the single species clusters. Our findings open the way for particle-level studies of nucleation and growth of icosahedral clusters, and of binary crystallization. The authors investigate out-of-equilibrium crystallization of a binary mixture of sphere-like nanoparticles in small droplets. They observe the spontaneous formation of an icosahedral structure with stable MgCu2 phases, which are promising for photonic applications.

Title: Atomic superheterodyne receiver based on microwave-dressed Rydberg spectroscopy

Date: 01 June 2020

Abstract:
Highly sensitive phase- and frequency-resolved detection of microwave electric fields is of central importance in a wide range of fields, including cosmology1,2, meteorology3, communication4 and microwave quantum technology5. Atom-based electrometers6,7 promise traceable standards for microwave electrometry, but their best sensitivity is currently limited to a few μV cm−1 Hz−1/2 (refs. 8,9) and they only yield information about the field amplitude and polarization10. Here, we demonstrate a conceptually new microwave electric field sensor—the Rydberg-atom superheterodyne receiver (superhet). The sensitivity of this technique scales favourably, achieving even 55 nV cm−1 Hz−1/2 with a modest set-up. The minimum detectable field of 780 pV cm−1 is three orders of magnitude smaller than what can be reached by existing atomic electrometers. The Rydberg-atom superhet allows SI-traceable measurements, reaching uncertainty levels of 10−8 V cm−1 when measuring a sub-μV cm−1 field, which has been inaccessible so far with atomic sensors. Our method also enables phase and frequency detection. In sensing Doppler frequencies, sub-μHz precision is reached for fields of a few hundred nV cm−1. This work is a first step towards realizing electromagnetic-wave quantum sensors with quantum projection noise-limited sensitivity. Such a device will impact diverse areas like radio astronomy, radar technology and metrology. The Rydberg-atom superhet, based on microwave-dressed Rydberg atoms and a tailored electromagnetically induced transparency spectrum, allows SI-traceable measurements of microwave electric fields with unprecedented sensitivity.

Title: A quantum memory at telecom wavelengths
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 18 May 2020

Abstract:
Nanofabricated mechanical resonators are gaining significant momentum among potential quantum technologies due to their unique design freedom and independence from naturally occurring resonances. As their functionality is widely detached from material choice, they constitute ideal tools for transducers—intermediaries between different quantum systems—and as memory elements in conjunction with quantum communication and computing devices. Their capability to host ultra-long-lived phonon modes is particularity attractive for non-classical information storage, both for future quantum technologies and for fundamental tests of physics. Here, we demonstrate a Duan–Lukin–Cirac–Zoller-type mechanical quantum memory with an energy decay time of T1 ≈ 2 ms, which is controlled through an optical interface engineered to natively operate at telecom wavelengths. We further investigate the coherence of the memory, equivalent to the dephasing $${T}_{2}^{* }$$ for qubits, which has a power-dependent value between 15 and 112 μs. This demonstration is enabled by an optical scheme to create a superposition state of $$\left|0\right\rangle +\left|1\right\rangle$$ mechanical excitations, with an arbitrary ratio between the vacuum and single-phonon components. By exploiting the long-lived phonon modes in nanoscale mechanical resonators, a quantum memory that operates around the standard telecom wavelength of 1,550 nm is realized on a silicon platform.

Title: Enhanced energy coupling for indirect-drive fast-ignition fusion targets
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 20 April 2020

Abstract:
One of the most promising approaches to reach a high gain in inertial confinement fusion is the fast ignition scheme. In this scheme, a relativistic electron beam is generated; this passes through the imploded plasma and deposits parts of its energy in the core. However, the large angular spread of the relativistic electron beam and the poorly controlled compression of the target affect realization of the fast ignition technique. Here, we demonstrate that indirectly driven (that is, driven by X-rays generated inside a gold hohlraum) implosions with a ‘high-foot’ and a short-coast time of less than 200 ps allow us to tightly compress the shell. Furthermore, we show the ability to optimize the symmetry of the imploding shell by changing the hohlraum length, successfully tuning a suitable tube-shaped shell to compensate for the large angular spread of the relativistic electron beam and to enhance the electron-to-core coupling efficiency via resistive magnetic fields. Benefiting from those experimental techniques, a significant enhancement in neutron yield was achieved in our indirectly driven fast ignition experiments. These results pave the way towards high-coupling fast ignition experiments with indirectly driven targets similar to those at the National Ignition Facility. Experiments realizing the indirect-drive fast ignition scheme for inertial confinement fusion are reported. Enabled by a tightly compressed target, an increase of neutron yield is observed.

Title: Flexible filaments buckle into helicoidal shapes in strong compressional flows
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 30 March 2020

Abstract:
The occurrence of coiled or helical morphologies is common in nature, from plant roots to DNA packaging into viral capsids, as well as in applications such as oil drilling processes. In many examples, chiral structures result from the buckling of a straight fibre either with intrinsic twist or to which end moments have been applied in addition to compression forces. Here, we elucidate a generic way to form regular helicoidal shapes from achiral straight filaments transported in viscous flows with free ends. Through a combination of experiments using fluorescently labelled actin filaments in microfluidic divergent flows and two distinct sets of numerical simulations, we demonstrate the robustness of helix formation. A nonlinear stability analysis is performed, and explains the emergence of such chiral structures from the nonlinear interaction of perpendicular planar buckling modes, an effect that solely requires a strong compressional flow, independent of the exact nature of the fibre or type of flow field. The fundamental mechanism for the uncovered morphological transition and characterization of the emerging conformations advance our understanding of several biological and industrial processes and can also be exploited for the controlled microfabrication of chiral objects. A general mechanism through which elastic filaments suspended in a strong compressional flow buckle and spontaneously acquire a chiral helicoidal shape is uncovered and elucidated theoretically.

Title: Distributed quantum sensing in a continuous-variable entangled network

Abstract:
Networking is integral to quantum communications1 and has significant potential for upscaling quantum computer technologies2. Recently, it was realized that the sensing performances of multiple spatially distributed parameters may also be enhanced through the use of an entangled quantum network3–10. Here, we experimentally demonstrate how sensing of an averaged phase shift among four distributed nodes benefits from an entangled quantum network. Using a four-mode entangled continuous-variable state, we demonstrate deterministic quantum phase sensing with a precision beyond what is attainable with separable probes. The techniques behind this result can have direct applications in a number of areas ranging from molecular tracking to quantum networks of atomic clocks. Experiments demonstrate quantum phase sensing with a four-mode entangled state, reaching a measurement precision that is beyond what can be achieved by separate individual probes.

Title: Long-range ballistic propagation of carriers in methylammonium lead iodide perovskite thin films
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 02 December 2019

Abstract:
The performance of semiconductor devices is fundamentally governed by charge-carrier dynamics within the active materials1–6. Although advances have been made towards understanding these dynamics under steady-state conditions, the importance of non-equilibrium phenomena and their effect on device performances remains elusive7,8. In fact, the ballistic propagation of carriers is generally considered to not contribute to the mechanism of photovoltaics (PVs) and light-emitting diodes, as scattering rapidly disrupts such processes after carrier generation via photon absorption or electric injection9. Here we characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of carriers immediately after photon absorption in methylammonium lead iodide perovskite films using femtosecond transient absorption microscopy (fs-TAM) with a 10 fs temporal resolution and 10 nm spatial precision. We found that non-equilibrium carriers propagate ballistically over 150 nm within 20 fs of photon absorption. Our results suggest that in a typical perovskite PV device operating under standard conditions, a large fraction of carriers can reach the charge collection layers ballistically. The ballistic transport distance appears to be limited by energetic disorder within the materials, probably due to disorder-induced scattering. This provides a direct route towards optimization of the ballistic transport distance via improvements in materials and by minimizing the energetic disorder. Our observations reveal an unexplored regime of carrier transport in perovskites, which could have important consequences for device performance. Charge-carrier dynamics are fundamental to the operation and performance of semiconductor devices. In methylammonium lead iodide perovskites, carriers in the non-equilibrium regime after excitation propagate ballistically over 150 nm within 20 fs.

Title: Determining eigenstates and thermal states on a quantum computer using quantum imaginary time evolution
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 11 November 2019

Abstract:
The accurate computation of Hamiltonian ground, excited and thermal states on quantum computers stands to impact many problems in the physical and computer sciences, from quantum simulation to machine learning. Given the challenges posed in constructing large-scale quantum computers, these tasks should be carried out in a resource-efficient way. In this regard, existing techniques based on phase estimation or variational algorithms display potential disadvantages; phase estimation requires deep circuits with ancillae, that are hard to execute reliably without error correction, while variational algorithms, while flexible with respect to circuit depth, entail additional high-dimensional classical optimization. Here, we introduce the quantum imaginary time evolution and quantum Lanczos algorithms, which are analogues of classical algorithms for finding ground and excited states. Compared with their classical counterparts, they require exponentially less space and time per iteration, and can be implemented without deep circuits and ancillae, or high-dimensional optimization. We furthermore discuss quantum imaginary time evolution as a subroutine to generate Gibbs averages through an analogue of minimally entangled typical thermal states. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of these algorithms via an implementation using exact classical emulation as well as through prototype circuits on the Rigetti quantum virtual machine and Aspen-1 quantum processing unit. The quantum imaginary time evolution and Lanczos algorithms offer a resource-efficient way to compute ground or excited states of target Hamiltonians on quantum computers. This offers promise for quantum simulation on near-term noisy devices.

Title: Dynamics of soliton crystals in optical microresonators
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 09 September 2019

Abstract:
Dissipative Kerr solitons in optical microresonators combine nonlinear optical physics with photonic-integrated technologies. They are promising for a number of applications ranging from optical coherent communications to astrophysical spectrometer calibration, and are also of fundamental interest to the physical sciences. Dissipative Kerr solitons can form a variety of stable states, including breathers and multiple-soliton formations. Among these states, soliton crystals stand out: temporally ordered ensembles of soliton pulses, which are regularly arranged by a modulation of the continuous-wave intracavity driving field. To date, however, the dynamics of soliton crystals and their defect-free generation remain unexplored. Here, we show that the chaotic operating regimes of driven optical microresonators significantly impact the dynamics of soliton crystals. We realize deterministic generation of perfect soliton crystal states, which correspond to a stable, defect-free lattice of intracavity optical pulses. We reveal a critical pump power, below which the stochastic process of soliton excitation abruptly becomes deterministic, which enables faultless, device-independent access to perfect soliton crystals. We also demonstrate the switching of these states and its relation to the regime of transient chaos. Finally, we report on other dynamical phenomena observed in soliton crystals including the formation of breathers, transitions between perfect soliton crystals, their melting and recrystallization. A dissipative Kerr soliton crystal state is a temporally ordered regular ensemble of soliton pulses within a cavity. Chaotic driving of optical resonators enables the defect-free creation and dynamical characterization of these states.

Title: Quantum convolutional neural networks
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 26 August 2019

Abstract:
Neural network-based machine learning has recently proven successful for many complex applications ranging from image recognition to precision medicine. However, its direct application to problems in quantum physics is challenging due to the exponential complexity of many-body systems. Motivated by recent advances in realizing quantum information processors, we introduce and analyse a quantum circuit-based algorithm inspired by convolutional neural networks, a highly effective model in machine learning. Our quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) uses only O(log(N)) variational parameters for input sizes of N qubits, allowing for its efficient training and implementation on realistic, near-term quantum devices. To explicitly illustrate its capabilities, we show that QCNNs can accurately recognize quantum states associated with a one-dimensional symmetry-protected topological phase, with performance surpassing existing approaches. We further demonstrate that QCNNs can be used to devise a quantum error correction scheme optimized for a given, unknown error model that substantially outperforms known quantum codes of comparable complexity. The potential experimental realizations and generalizations of QCNNs are also discussed. A quantum circuit-based algorithm inspired by convolutional neural networks is shown to successfully perform quantum phase recognition and devise quantum error correcting codes when applied to arbitrary input quantum states.

Title: Subcycle squeezing of light from a time flow perspective
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 01 July 2019

Abstract:
Light as a carrier of information and energy plays a fundamental role in both general relativity and quantum physics, linking these areas that are still not fully compliant with each other. Usually the quantum nature of light is described in the frequency domain. Even for broadband quantum states with a well-defined carrier frequency, a quasi-continuous-wave picture is still applicable. However, recent access to subcycle quantum features of electromagnetic radiation promises a new class of time-dependent quantum states of light. Paralleled with the developments in attosecond science, these advances motivate an urgent need for a theoretical framework that treats arbitrary wavepackets of quantum light intrinsically in the time domain. Here, we formulate a consistent time-domain theory of the generation and sampling of few-cycle and subcycle pulsed squeezed states, leading to a relativistic interpretation in terms of induced changes in the local flow of time. Our theory enables the use of such states as a resource for novel ultrafast applications in quantum optics and quantum information. A general theoretical picture regarding the generation and the detection of extremely short pulses of squeezed vacuum light is provided, allowing the treatment of arbitrary wavepackets of quantum light intrinsically in the time domain.

Title: Collective mechanical adaptation of honeybee swarms
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 17 September 2018

Abstract:
Honeybee Apis mellifera swarms form large congested tree-hanging clusters made solely of bees attached to each other1. How these structures are maintained under the influence of dynamic mechanical forcing is unknown. To address this, we created pendant clusters and subject them to dynamic loads of varying orientation, amplitude, frequency and duration. We find that horizontally shaken clusters adapt by spreading out to form wider, flatter cones that recover their original shape when unloaded. Measuring the response of a cluster to an impulsive pendular excitation shows that flattened cones deform less and relax faster than the elongated ones (that is, they are more stable). Particle-based simulations of a passive assemblage suggest a behavioural hypothesis: individual bees respond to local variations in strain by moving up the strain gradient, which is qualitatively consistent with our observations of individual bee movement during dynamic loading. The simulations also suggest that vertical shaking will not lead to significant differential strains and thus no shape adaptation, which we confirmed experimentally. Together, our findings highlight how a super-organismal structure responds to dynamic loading by actively changing its morphology to improve the collective stability of the cluster at the expense of increasing the average mechanical burden of an individual. Suspended clusters of honeybees withstand dynamic mechanical forcing from their environment. Experiments and simulations suggest that collective stability relies on individual bees responding to local variations in strain.

Title: Transport and dispersion across wiggling nanopores
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 06 August 2018

Abstract:
The transport of fluids at the nanoscale has achieved major breakthroughs over recent years1–4; however, artificial channels still cannot match the efficiency of biological porins in terms of fluxes or selectivity. Pore shape agitation—due to thermal fluctuations or in response to external stimuli—is believed to facilitate transport in biochannels5–9, but its impact on transport in artificial pores remains largely unexplored. Here we introduce a general theory for transport through thermally or actively fluctuating channels, which quantifies the impact of pore fluctuations on confined diffusion in terms of the spectral statistics of the channel fluctuations. Our findings demonstrate a complex interplay between transport and surface wiggling: agitation enhances diffusion via the induced fluid flow, but spatial variations in pore geometry can induce a slowing down via entropic trapping, in full agreement with molecular dynamics simulations and existing observations from the literature. Our results elucidate the impact of pore agitation in a broad range of artificial and biological porins, but also, at larger scales, in vascular motion in fungi, intestinal contractions and microfluidic surface waves. These results open up the possibility that transport across membranes can be actively tuned by external stimuli, with potential applications to nanoscale pumping, osmosis and dynamical ultrafiltration. Fluid transport at the nanoscale is important for understanding a range of phenomena in biological and physical systems. A theory accounting for transport through fluctuating channels is presented, providing a framework for designing active membranes.

Title: Experimental evidence for ultrafast intermolecular relaxation processes in hydrated biomolecules
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 23 July 2018

Abstract:
Cell and gene damage caused by ionizing radiation has been studied for many years. It is accepted that DNA lesions (single- and double-strand breaks, for example) are induced by secondary species such as radicals, ions and the abundant low-energy secondary electrons generated by the primary radiation. Particularly harmful are dense ionization clusters of several ionization processes within a volume typical for the biomolecular system. Here we report the observation of a damage mechanism in the form of a non-local autoionizing process called intermolecular Coulombic decay (ICD). It directly involves DNA constituents or other organic molecules in an aqueous environment. The products are two energetic ions and three reactive secondary electrons that can cause further damage in their vicinity. Hydrogen-bonded complexes that consist of one tetrahydrofuran (THF) molecule—a surrogate of deoxyribose in the DNA backbone—and one water molecule are used as a model system. After electron impact ionization of the water molecule in the inner-valence shell the vacancy is filled by an outer-valence electron. The released energy is transferred across the hydrogen bridge and leads to ionization of the neighbouring THF molecule. This energy transfer from water to THF is faster than the otherwise occurring intermolecular proton transfer. The signature of the ICD reaction is identified in triple-coincidence measurements of both ions and one of the final state electrons. These results could improve the understanding of radiation damage in biological tissue. The authors study intermolecular Coulomb decay that occurs in a sample of THF and water in a reaction microscope employing triple-coincidence measurements of two ions and one electron. They find that ICD is a previously unconsidered effect between water and other organic molecules that are hydrogen-bonded, with ICD outpacing proton transfer.

Title: Laser cooling of optically trapped molecules
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 25 June 2018

Abstract:
Ultracold molecules are ideal platforms for many important applications, ranging from quantum simulation1–5 and quantum information processing 6,7 to precision tests of fundamental physics2,8–11. Producing trapped, dense samples of ultracold molecules is a challenging task. One promising approach is direct laser cooling, which can be applied to several classes of molecules not easily assembled from ultracold atoms12,13. Here, we report the production of trapped samples of laser-cooled CaF molecules with densities of 8 × 107 cm−3 and at phase-space densities of 2 × 10−9, 35 times higher than for sub-Doppler-cooled samples in free space14. These advances are made possible by efficient laser cooling of optically trapped molecules to well below the Doppler limit, a key step towards many future applications. These range from ultracold chemistry to quantum simulation, where conservative trapping of cold and dense samples is desirable. In addition, the ability to cool optically trapped molecules opens up new paths towards quantum degeneracy. Laser cooling of optically trapped diatomic molecules CaF to sub-Doppler temperatures has been achieved. The technique provides an alternative approach towards the production of ultracold polar molecules.

Title: Direct evidence of ferromagnetism in a quantum anomalous Hall system
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 28 May 2018

Abstract:
Quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) systems are of great fundamental interest and potential application because of their dissipationless conduction without the need for an external magnetic field1–9. The QAH effect has been realized in magnetically doped topological insulator thin films10–14. However, full quantization requires extremely low temperature (T &lt; 50 mK) in the earliest works, athough it has been significantly improved by modulation doping or co-doping of magnetic elements15,16. Improved ferromagnetism has been shown in these thin films, yet direct evidence of long-range ferromagnetic order is lacking. Herein, we present direct visualization of long-range ferromagnetic order in thin films of Cr and V co-doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3 using low-temperature magnetic force microscopy with in situ transport. The magnetization reversal process reveals typical ferromagnetic domain behaviour—that is, domain nucleation and possibly domain wall propagation—in contrast to much weaker magnetic signals observed in the endmembers, possibly due to superparamagnetic behaviour17–19. The observed long-range ferromagnetic order resolves one of the major challenges in QAH systems, and paves the way towards high-temperature dissipationless conduction by exploring magnetic topological insulators. Long-range ferromagnetic order in co-doped topological insulator thin films and their typical ferromagnetic domain behaviour is directly evidenced by low-temperature magnetic force microscopy.

Title: Equilibrium free energies from non-equilibrium trajectories with relaxation fluctuation spectroscopy
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 28 May 2018

Abstract:
Recent advances in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and single-molecule measurements have enabled the determination of equilibrium free energies from non-equilibrium work measurements for fluctuating systems ranging from biological molecules to quantum oscillators. However, for many important non-equilibrium processes, it is difficult or impossible to apply and measure the work required to drive the system through the relevant conformational changes. Here, we show that it is possible, with an appropriate extrapolation to infinite temporal scale and zero spatial scale, to determine equilibrium free energies, without work measurement, by analysing the stochastic trajectories of single biomolecules or other nanoscale, fluctuating systems as they spontaneously relax from a non-equilibrium initial state. We validate the method with simulations and demonstrate its application by determining the free-energy profile for DNA molecules in a structured nanofluidic environment with an experimental protocol that mimics many natural processes with energy injection followed by thermal relaxation. Non-equilibrium physics grants access to equilibrium free energies from the work performed on fluctuating systems—but only when the work itself is measurable. Relaxation fluctuation spectroscopy provides an alternative route to these energies.

Title: Attosecond optical-field-enhanced carrier injection into the GaAs conduction band
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 12 March 2018

Abstract:
Resolving the fundamental carrier dynamics induced in solids by strong electric fields is essential for future applications, ranging from nanoscale transistors1,2 to high-speed electro-optical switches3. How fast and at what rate can electrons be injected into the conduction band of a solid? Here, we investigate the sub-femtosecond response of GaAs induced by resonant intense near-infrared laser pulses using attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. In particular, we unravel the distinct role of intra- versus interband transitions. Surprisingly, we found that despite the resonant driving laser, the optical response during the light–matter interaction is dominated by intraband motion. Furthermore, we observed that the coupling between the two mechanisms results in a significant enhancement of the carrier injection from the valence into the conduction band. This is especially unexpected as the intraband mechanism itself can accelerate carriers only within the same band. This physical phenomenon could be used to control ultrafast carrier excitation and boost injection rates in electronic switches in the petahertz regime. Significant enhancement of carrier injection into the conduction band is observed for GaAs subjected to intense resonant near-infrared laser pumping. Attosecond-resolved investigation reveals the interplay between the intra- and interband transitions.

Title: Femtosecond activation of magnetoelectricity
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 31 January 2018

Abstract:
In magnetoelectric and multiferroic materials, the magnetic degree of freedom can be controlled by electric field, and vice versa. A significant amount of research has been devoted to exploiting this effect for magnetoelectric data storage and manipulation devices driven by d.c. electric fields1–4. Aiming at ever-faster schemes of magnetoelectric manipulation, a promising alternative approach offers similar control on a femtosecond timescale, relying on laser pulses4–6 to control both the charge7,8 and the magnetic9,10 order of solids. Here we photo-induce magnetoelectricity and multiferroicity in CuB2O4 on a sub-picosecond timescale. This process is triggered by the resonant optical generation of the highest-energy magnetic excitations—magnons with wavevectors near the edges of the Brillouin zone. The most striking consequence of the photo-excitation is that the absorption of light becomes non-reciprocal, which means that the material exhibits a different transparency for two opposite directions of propagation of light. The photo-induced magnetoelectricity does not show any decay on the picosecond timescale. Our findings uncover a path for ultrafast manipulations of the intrinsic coupling between charges and spins in multiferroics 4 , which may reveal unexplored magnetic configurations and unravel new functionalities in terms of femtosecond optical control of magnetism. Pump–probe measurements of CuB2O4 reveal non-reciprocal directional dichroism, demonstrating the possibility to optically induce magnetoelectricity in a material on a femtosecond timescale.

Title: Self-peeling of impacting droplets
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 11 September 2017

Abstract:
When molten tin droplets impact clean substrates, they either stick or spontaneously detach depending on the substrate temperature. Competition between heat extraction and fluidity controls this behaviour, forgoing the need for surface treatment. Whether an impacting droplet1 sticks or not to a solid surface has been conventionally controlled by functionalizing the target surface2,3,4,5,6,7,8 or by using additives in the drop9,10. Here we report on an unexpected self-peeling phenomenon that can happen even on smooth untreated surfaces by taking advantage of the solidification of the impacting drop and the thermal properties of the substrate. We control this phenomenon by tuning the coupling of the short-timescale fluid dynamics—leading to interfacial defects upon local freezing—and the longer-timescale thermo-mechanical stresses—leading to global deformation. We establish a regime map that predicts whether a molten metal drop impacting onto a colder substrate11,12,13,14 will bounce, stick or self-peel. In many applications, avoiding adhesion of impacting droplets around designated target surfaces can be as crucial as bonding onto them to minimize waste or cleaning. These insights have broad applicability in processes ranging from thermal spraying12,15 and additive manufacturing16,17,18,19 to extreme ultraviolet lithography20.

Title: Superballistic flow of viscous electron fluid through graphene constrictions
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 21 August 2017

Abstract:
Graphene systems are clean platforms for studying electron–electron (e–e) collisions. Electron transport in graphene constrictions is now found to behave anomalously due to e–e interactions: conductance values exceed the maximum free-electron value. Electron–electron (e–e) collisions can impact transport in a variety of surprising and sometimes counterintuitive ways1,2,3,4,5,6. Despite strong interest, experiments on the subject proved challenging because of the simultaneous presence of different scattering mechanisms that suppress or obscure consequences of e–e scattering7,8,9,10,11. Only recently, sufficiently clean electron systems with transport dominated by e–e collisions have become available, showing behaviour characteristic of highly viscous fluids12,13,14. Here we study electron transport through graphene constrictions and show that their conductance below 150 K increases with increasing temperature, in stark contrast to the metallic character of doped graphene15. Notably, the measured conductance exceeds the maximum conductance possible for free electrons16,17. This anomalous behaviour is attributed to collective movement of interacting electrons, which ‘shields’ individual carriers from momentum loss at sample boundaries18,19. The measurements allow us to identify the conductance contribution arising due to electron viscosity and determine its temperature dependence. Besides fundamental interest, our work shows that viscous effects can facilitate high-mobility transport at elevated temperatures, a potentially useful behaviour for designing graphene-based&nbsp;devices.

Title: Tracing the phase of focused broadband laser pulses
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 10 July 2017

Abstract:
In different applications the Gouy phase is used to describe broadband lasers, but new 3D measurements of the spatial dependence of a focused laser pulse show serious deviations from the Gouy phase. Precise knowledge of the behaviour of the phase of light in a focused beam is fundamental to understanding and controlling laser-driven processes. More than a hundred years ago, an axial phase anomaly for focused monochromatic light beams was discovered and is now commonly known as the Gouy phase1,2,3,4. Recent theoretical work has brought into question the validity of applying this monochromatic phase formulation to the broadband pulses becoming ubiquitous today5,6. Based on electron backscattering at sharp nanometre-scale metal tips, a method is available to measure light fields with sub-wavelength spatial resolution and sub-optical-cycle time resolution7,8,9. Here we report such a direct, three-dimensional measurement of the spatial dependence of the optical phase of a focused, 4-fs, near-infrared pulsed laser beam. The observed optical phase deviates substantially from the monochromatic Gouy phase—exhibiting a much more complex spatial dependence, both along the propagation axis and in the radial direction. In our measurements, these significant deviations are the rule and not the exception for focused, broadband laser pulses. Therefore, we expect wide ramifications for all broadband laser–matter interactions, such as in high-harmonic and attosecond pulse generation, femtochemistry10, ophthalmological optical coherence tomography11,12 and light-wave electronics13.

Title: Mixed electrochemical–ferroelectric states in nanoscale ferroelectrics
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 01 May 2017

Abstract:
Ferroelectricity on the nanoscale has been the subject of much fascination in condensed-matter physics for over half a century. In recent years, multiple reports claiming ferroelectricity in ultrathin ferroelectric films based on the formation of remnant polarization states, local electromechanical hysteresis loops, and pressure-induced switching were made. However, similar phenomena were reported for traditionally non-ferroelectric materials, creating a significant level of uncertainty in the field. Here we show that in nanoscale systems the ferroelectric state is fundamentally inseparable from the electrochemical state of the surface, leading to the emergence of a mixed electrochemical–ferroelectric state. We explore the nature, thermodynamics, and thickness evolution of such states, and demonstrate the experimental pathway to establish its presence. This analysis reconciles multiple prior studies, provides guidelines for studies of ferroelectric materials on the nanoscale, and establishes the design paradigm for new generations of ferroelectric-based devices. Nanoscale ferroelectricity is hard to characterize. Studies of BaTiO3 thin films now reveal a close coupling between the ferroelectric and the surface electrochemical states&nbsp;—&nbsp;a notion important for future applications of ferroelectric nanomaterials.

Title: Controlled state-to-state atom-exchange reaction in an ultracold atom–dimer mixture
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 10 April 2017

Abstract:
Ultracold molecules offer remarkable opportunities for the study of chemical reactions close to zero temperature. Although significant progress has been achieved in exploring ultracold bimolecular reactions, the investigations are usually limited to measurements of the overall loss rates of the reactants. Detection of the reaction products will improve our understanding of the reaction mechanism and provide a unique opportunity to study the state-to-state reaction dynamics. Here we report on the direct observation of an exoergic atom-exchange reaction in an ultracold atom–dimer mixture. Both the atom and molecule products are observed and the state-to-state reaction rate coefficient is measured. By changing the magnetic field, the reaction can be switched on or off, and the rate coefficient can be controlled. The observed atom-exchange reaction is an effective spin-exchange interaction between the dimer and the atom and may be exploited to study the Kondo effect with ultracold atoms. Products from ultracold atom–dimer exothermic reactions can be directly observed by controlling the energy released during the process, bringing the study of chemical dynamics to the quantum level.

Title: Signatures of interaction-induced helical gaps in nanowire quantum point contacts
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 20 March 2017

Abstract:
Signatures of spin–momentum-locked gap states in nanowire quantum point contacts that have all-electrical origin could provide the conditions for the quasiparticle excitations required for topological quantum computing. Spin–momentum locking in a semiconductor device with strong spin–orbit coupling (SOC) is thought to be an important prerequisite for the formation of Majorana bound states1,2,3. Such a helical state is predicted in one-dimensional (1D) nanowires subject to strong Rashba SOC and spin-mixing4—its hallmark being a characteristic re-entrant behaviour in the conductance. Here, we report direct experimental observations of the re-entrant conductance feature, which reveals the formation of a helical liquid, in the lowest 1D subband of an InAs nanowire. Surprisingly, the feature is very prominent also in the absence of magnetic fields. This behaviour suggests that exchange interactions have a substantial impact on transport in our device. We attribute the opening of the pseudogap to spin-flipping two-particle backscattering5,6,7. The all-electric origin of the ideal helical transport could have important implications for topological quantum computing.

Title: High-harmonic generation from an atomically thin semiconductor
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 14 November 2016

Abstract:
Observations of high-harmonic generation from a single layer of a transition metal dichalcogenide opens the door to studying strong-field and attosecond phenomena in two-dimensional materials. High-harmonic generation (HHG) in bulk solids permits the exploration of materials in a new regime of strong fields and attosecond timescales1,2,3,4,5,6. The generation process has been discussed in the context of strongly driven electron dynamics in single-particle bands7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14. Two-dimensional materials exhibit distinctive electronic properties compared to the bulk that could significantly modify the HHG process15,16, including different symmetries17,18,19, access to individual valleys20,21 and enhanced many-body interactions22,23,24,25. Here we demonstrate non-perturbative HHG from a monolayer MoS2 crystal, with even and odd harmonics extending to the 13th order. The even orders are predominantly polarized perpendicular to the pump and are compatible with the anomalous transverse intraband current arising from the material’s Berry curvature, while the weak parallel component suggests the importance of interband transitions. The odd harmonics exhibit a significant enhancement in efficiency per layer compared to the bulk, which is attributed to correlation effects. The combination of strong many-body Coulomb interactions and widely tunable electronic properties in two-dimensional materials offers a new platform for attosecond physics.

Title: Strongly exchange-coupled triplet pairs in an organic semiconductor
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 17 October 2016

Abstract:
From biological complexes to devices based on organic semiconductors, spin interactions play a key role in the function of molecular systems. For instance, triplet-pair reactions impact operation of organic light-emitting diodes as well as photovoltaic devices. Conventional models for triplet pairs assume they interact only weakly. Here, using electron spin resonance, we observe long-lived, strongly interacting triplet pairs in an organic semiconductor, generated via singlet fission. Using coherent spin manipulation of these two-triplet states, we identify exchange-coupled (spin-2) quintet complexes coexisting with weakly coupled (spin-1) triplets. We measure strongly coupled pairs with a lifetime approaching 3 μs and a spin coherence time approaching 1 μs, at 10 K. Our results pave the way for the utilization of high-spin systems in organic semiconductors. Experiments show how molecular structure affects the interaction and dynamics of the triplet exciton pairs produced when an excited singlet exciton decays via singlet fission — a process that could be harnessed for optoelectronic applications.

Title: Stokes solitons in optical microcavities
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 05 September 2016

Abstract:
Solitonic modes that are redshifted due to a Raman-related effect are reported in optical microcavities, and termed Stokes solitons. Solitons are wave packets that resist dispersion through a self-induced potential well. They are studied in many fields, but are especially well known in optics on account of the relative ease of their formation and control in optical fibre waveguides1,2. Besides their many interesting properties, solitons are important to optical continuum generation3, in mode-locked lasers4,5, and have been considered as a natural way to convey data over great distances6. Recently, solitons have been realized in microcavities7, thereby bringing the power of microfabrication methods to future applications. This work reports a soliton not previously observed in optical systems, the Stokes soliton. The Stokes soliton forms and regenerates by optimizing its Raman interaction in space and time within an optical potential well shared with another soliton. The Stokes and the initial soliton belong to distinct transverse mode families and benefit from a form of soliton trapping that is new to microcavities and soliton lasers in general. The discovery of a new optical soliton can impact work in other areas of photonics, including nonlinear optics and spectroscopy.

Here, we report the first experimental demonstration of optical anti-PT symmetry—the counterpart of conventional PT symmetry—in a warm atomic-vapour cell. Rapid coherence transport via flying atoms leads to a dissipative coupling between two long-lived atomic spin waves, allowing for the observation of the essential features of anti-PT symmetry with unprecedented precision on the phase-transition threshold, as well as refractionless light propagation. Moreover, we show that a linear or nonlinear interaction between the two spatially separated beams can be achieved. Our results advance non-Hermitian physics by bridging to the field of atomic, molecular and optical physics, where new phenomena and applications in quantum and nonlinear optics aided by (anti-)PT symmetry could be anticipated. Parity–time symmetry in optics is studied in a warm atomic vapour, where its counterpart, anti-parity–time symmetry, as well as refractionless propagation, can also be observed.

Title: Hidden geometric correlations in real multiplex networks
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 04 July 2016

Abstract:
Real networks often form interacting parts of larger and more complex systems. Examples can be found in different domains, ranging from the Internet to structural and functional brain networks. Here, we show that these multiplex systems are not random combinations of single network layers. Instead, they are organized in specific ways dictated by hidden geometric correlations between the layers. We find that these correlations are significant in different real multiplexes, and form a key framework for answering many important questions. Specifically, we show that these geometric correlations facilitate the definition and detection of multidimensional communities, which are sets of nodes that are simultaneously similar in multiple layers. They also enable accurate trans-layer link prediction, meaning that connections in one layer can be predicted by observing the hidden geometric space of another layer. And they allow efficient targeted navigation in the multilayer system using only local knowledge, outperforming navigation in the single layers only if the geometric correlations are sufficiently&nbsp;strong. Multiplex networks are shown to harbour significant correlations between layers. A framework describing the correlations enables multilayer community and link detection, and reveals that they improve navigation&nbsp;—&nbsp;but only when they’re strong.

Title: Ultra-low magnetic damping of a metallic ferromagnet
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 16 May 2016

Abstract:
Materials with low magnetic damping are important for a range of applications but are typically insulating, which limits their use. Thanks to a unique feature of the band structure, similar levels of damping can now be achieved in a metallic alloy. Magnetic damping is of critical importance for devices that seek to exploit the electronic spin degree of freedom, as damping strongly affects the energy required and speed at which a device can operate. However, theory has struggled to quantitatively predict the damping, even in common ferromagnetic materials1,2,3. This presents a challenge for a broad range of applications in spintronics4 and spin-orbitronics that depend on materials and structures with ultra-low damping5,6. It is believed that achieving ultra-low damping in metallic ferromagnets is limited by the scattering of magnons by the conduction electrons. However, we report on a binary alloy of cobalt and iron that overcomes this obstacle and exhibits a damping parameter approaching 10−4, which is comparable to values reported only for ferrimagnetic insulators7,8. We explain this phenomenon by a unique feature of the band structure in this system: the density of states exhibits a sharp minimum at the Fermi level at the same alloy concentration at which the minimum in the magnetic damping is&nbsp;found. This discovery provides both a significant fundamental understanding of damping mechanisms and a test of the theoretical predictions proposed by Mankovsky and colleagues3.

Title: Probing the Bose glass–superfluid transition using quantum quenches of disorder
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 14 March 2016

Abstract:
Aspects of the disordered Bose–Hubbard model, such as the Bose glass–superfluid transition, are still incompletely understood, but this can now be probed in an ultracold atomic gas in an optical lattice using controlled quantum quenches of disorder. The disordered Bose–Hubbard model—a paradigm for strongly correlated and disordered bosonic systems1—is central to our understanding of quantum phase transitions2. Despite extensive theoretical work on the disordered Bose–Hubbard model, little is known about the impact of temperature, the dynamical behaviour of quantum phases, and how equilibrium is affected during quantum phase transitions. These issues are critically important to applications such as quantum annealing3,4,5,6,7 and electronics based on quantum phase transitions8. Here, we use a quantum quench of disorder in an ultracold lattice gas to dynamically probe the superfluid–Bose glass quantum phase transition at non-zero temperature ( Fig.&nbsp;1). By measuring excitations generated during the quench, we provide evidence for superfluid puddles in the Bose glass phase and produce a superfluid–Bose glass phase diagram consistent with completely constrained, finite temperature, and equilibrium quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The residual energy from the quench, which is an efficacy measure for optimization through quantum annealing, is unchanged for quench times spanning nearly a hundred tunnelling times.

Title: Tuning ultrafast electron thermalization pathways in a van der Waals heterostructure
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 18 January 2016

Abstract:
Interlayer transport can be made to occur slower or faster than intralayer scattering in van der Waals heterostructures, allowing the thermalization pathways for optically excited carriers to be tuned. Ultrafast electron thermalization—the process leading to carrier multiplication via impact ionization1,2, and hot-carrier luminescence3,4—occurs when optically excited electrons in a material undergo rapid electron–electron scattering3,5,6,7 to redistribute excess energy and reach electronic thermal equilibrium. Owing to extremely short time and length scales, the measurement and manipulation of electron thermalization in nanoscale devices remains challenging even with the most advanced ultrafast laser techniques8,9,10,11,12,13,14. Here, we overcome this challenge by leveraging the atomic thinness of two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) materials to introduce a highly tunable electron transfer pathway that directly competes with electron thermalization. We realize this scheme in a graphene–boron nitride–graphene (G–BN–G) vdW heterostructure15,16,17, through which optically excited carriers are transported from one graphene layer to the other. By applying an interlayer bias voltage or varying the excitation photon energy, interlayer carrier transport can be controlled to occur faster or slower than the intralayer scattering events, thus effectively tuning the electron thermalization pathways in graphene. Our findings, which demonstrate a means to probe and directly modulate electron energy transport in nanoscale materials, represent a step towards designing and implementing optoelectronic and energy-harvesting devices with tailored microscopic properties.

Title: Visualizing fast electron energy transport into laser-compressed high-density fast-ignition targets
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 11 January 2016

Abstract:
Recent progress in kilojoule-scale high-intensity lasers has opened up new areas of research in radiography, laboratory astrophysics, high-energy-density physics, and fast-ignition (FI) laser fusion. FI requires efficient heating of pre-compressed high-density fuel by an intense relativistic electron beam produced from laser–matter interaction. Understanding the details of electron beam generation and transport is crucial for FI. Here we report on the first visualization of fast electron spatial energy deposition in a laser-compressed cone-in-shell FI target, facilitated by doping the shell with copper and imaging the K-shell radiation. Multi-scale simulations accompanying the experiments clearly show the location of fast electrons and reveal key parameters affecting energy coupling. The approach provides a more direct way to infer energy coupling and guide experimental designs that significantly improve the laser-to-core coupling to 7%. Our findings lay the groundwork for further improving efficiency, with 15% energy coupling predicted in FI experiments using an existing megajoule-scale laser driver. Fast-ignition laser fusion involves directing an intense relativistic electron beam onto a fuel target. Experiments and simulations now enable a visualization of the location of fast electrons and the energy-coupling mechanisms at play.

Title: Generation of heralded entanglement between distant hole spins
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 21 December 2015

Abstract:
The detection of a single photon heralds the projection of two remote spins onto a maximally entangled state. This has been demonstrated for quantum-dot hole spins, featuring a fast generation rate that could enable quantum technology applications. Quantum entanglement emerges naturally in interacting quantum systems and plays a central role in quantum information processing1,2,3,4. But the generation of entanglement does not require direct interactions: single-photon detection in spin-flip Raman scattering projects two distant spins onto a maximally entangled state, provided that it is impossible to determine the source of the detected photon5. Here, we demonstrate such heralded quantum entanglement6,7,8,9 of two quantum-dot hole spins separated by 5 m using single-photon interference. Thanks to fast spin initialization in 10 ns, hole-spin coherence lasting ∼40 ns and efficient photon extraction from dots10,11,12 embedded in leaky microcavity structures, we generate 2,300 entangled spin pairs per second, which represents a 1,000-fold improvement as compared to previous experiments13. The delayed two-photon interference scheme we developed allows the efficient verification of quantum correlations. Combined with schemes for transferring quantum information to a long-lived memory qubit14, fast entanglement generation could impact quantum repeater architectures.

Title: Cassini in situ observations of long-duration magnetic reconnection in Saturn’s magnetotail
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 30 November 2015

Abstract:
Cassini’s encounter with Saturn’s magnetotail — the long magnetosphere region stretching into space — has revealed that plasma exits the magnetosphere through long-duration magnetic reconnection, which ejects ten times more mass than estimated. Magnetic reconnection is a fundamental process in solar system and astrophysical plasmas, through which stored magnetic energy associated with current sheets is converted into thermal, kinetic and wave energy1,2,3,4. Magnetic reconnection is also thought to be a key process involved in shedding internally produced plasma from the giant magnetospheres at Jupiter and Saturn through topological reconfiguration of the magnetic field5,6. The region where magnetic fields reconnect is known as the diffusion region and in this letter we report on the first encounter of the Cassini spacecraft with a diffusion region in Saturn’s magnetotail. The data also show evidence of magnetic reconnection over a period of 19 h revealing that reconnection can, in fact, act for prolonged intervals in a rapidly rotating magnetosphere. We show that reconnection can be a significant pathway for internal plasma loss at Saturn6. This counters the view of reconnection as a transient method of internal plasma loss at Saturn5,7. These results, although directly relating to the magnetosphere of Saturn, have applications in the understanding of other rapidly rotating magnetospheres, including that of Jupiter and other astrophysical bodies.

Title: Probing the quantum vacuum with an artificial atom in front of a mirror
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 28 September 2015

Abstract:
Quantum fluctuations of the vacuum are both a surprising and fundamental phenomenon of nature. Understood as virtual photons, they still have a very real impact, for instance, in the Casimir effects and the lifetimes of atoms. Engineering vacuum fluctuations is therefore becoming increasingly important to emerging technologies. Here, we shape vacuum fluctuations using a superconducting circuit analogue of a mirror, creating regions in space where they are suppressed. Moving an artificial atom through these regions and measuring the spontaneous emission lifetime of the atom provides us with the spectral density of the vacuum fluctuations. Using the paradigm of waveguide quantum electrodynamics, we significantly improve over previous studies of the interaction of an atom with its mirror image, observing a spectral density as low as 0.02 quanta, a factor of 50 below the mirrorless result. This demonstrates that we can hide the atom from the vacuum, even though it is exposed in free&nbsp;space. Using a superconducting circuit analogue of an atom in front of a mirror it is possible to shape the modes of the quantum vacuum and hide the atom from the vacuum fluctuations.

Title: Spectrum of controlling and observing complex networks
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 10 August 2015

Abstract:
Recent studies have made important advances in identifying sensor or driver nodes, through which we can observe or control a complex system. But the observational uncertainty induced by measurement noise and the energy required for control continue to be significant challenges in practical applications. Here we show that the variability of control energy and observational uncertainty for different directions of the state space depend strongly on the number of driver nodes. In particular, we find that if all nodes are directly driven, control is energetically feasible, as the maximum energy increases sublinearly with the system size. If, however, we aim to control a system through a single node, control in some directions is energetically prohibitive, increasing exponentially with the system size. For the cases in between, the maximum energy decays exponentially when the number of driver nodes increases. We validate our findings in several model and real networks, arriving at a series of fundamental laws to describe the control energy that together deepen our understanding of complex systems. The complex interactions inherent in real-world networks grant us precise system control via manipulation of a subset of nodes. It turns out that the extent to which we can exercise this control depends sensitively on the number of nodes perturbed.

Title: Strong mechanical driving of a single electron spin
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 03 August 2015

Abstract:
The efficient and robust manipulation of single spins is an essential requirement for successful quantum devices. The manipulation of a single nitrogen–vacancy spin centre is now demonstrated by means of a mechanical resonator approach. Quantum devices for sensing and computing applications require coherent quantum systems, which can be manipulated in fast and robust ways1. Such quantum control is typically achieved using external electromagnetic fields, which drive the system’s orbital2, charge3 or spin4,5 degrees of freedom. However, most existing approaches require complex and unwieldy gate structures, and with few exceptions6,7 are limited to the regime of weak coherent driving. Here, we present a novel approach to coherently drive a single electronic spin using internal strain fields8,9,10 in an integrated quantum device. Specifically, we employ time-varying strain in a diamond cantilever to induce long-lasting, coherent oscillations of an embedded nitrogen–vacancy (NV) centre spin. We perform direct spectroscopy of the phonon-dressed states emerging from this drive and observe hallmarks of the sought-after strong-driving regime6,11, where the spin rotation frequency exceeds the spin splitting. Furthermore, we employ our continuous strain driving to significantly enhance the NV’s spin coherence time12. Our room-temperature experiments thereby constitute an important step towards strain-driven, integrated quantum devices and open new perspectives to investigate unexplored regimes of strongly driven multilevel systems13 and exotic spin dynamics in hybrid spin-oscillator&nbsp;devices14.

Title: Linear relation between Heisenberg exchange and interfacial Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction in metal films
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 03 August 2015

Abstract:
The Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya exchange induces a range of chiral phenomena in spintronic systems. Experiments now confirm that this interaction is proportional to the Heisenberg exchange, reflecting their common origins despite their opposite symmetries. Proposals for novel spin-orbitronic logic1 and memory devices2 are often predicated on assumptions as to how materials with large spin–orbit coupling interact with ferromagnets when in contact. Such interactions give rise to a host of novel phenomena, such as spin–orbit torques3,4, chiral spin structures5,6 and chiral spin torques7,8. These chiral properties are related to the antisymmetric exchange, also referred to as the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction (DMI; refs&nbsp;9, 10). For numerous phenomena, the relative strengths of the symmetric Heisenberg exchange and the DMI are of great importance. Here, we use optical spin-wave spectroscopy (Brillouin light scattering) to directly determine the volume-averaged DMI vector D for a series of Ni80Fe20/Pt thin films, and then compare the nearest-neighbour DMI coupling energy with an independently measured value of the Heisenberg exchange for each sample. We show that the dependence on Ni80Fe20 thickness of both the microscopic symmetric and antisymmetric exchange are nearly identical, consistent with the notion that the fundamentals of the DMI and Heisenberg exchange essentially share the same underlying physics, albeit with different symmetries, as was originally proposed by Moriya11 for superexchange in magnetic oxides, and by Fert and Levy12 for RKKY coupling in metallic spin glasses. Indeed, our result demonstrates the generality of the original DMI theory, insofar as the proportionality of the symmetric and antisymmetric exchange is robust with regard to the details of spin coupling for the material system in question. Although of significant fundamental importance, this result also leads us to a deeper understanding of DMI and how it could be optimized for spin-orbitronic applications.

Title: Direct measurement of the exciton binding energy and effective masses for charge carriers in organic–inorganic tri-halide perovskites
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 15 June 2015

Abstract:
Solar cells based on the organic–inorganic tri-halide perovskite family of materials have shown significant progress recently, offering the prospect of low-cost solar energy from devices that are very simple to process. Fundamental to understanding the operation of these devices is the exciton binding energy, which has proved both difficult to measure directly and controversial. We demonstrate that by using very high magnetic fields it is possible to make an accurate and direct spectroscopic measurement of the exciton binding energy, which we find to be only 16 meV at low temperatures, over three times smaller than has been previously assumed. In the room-temperature phase we show that the binding energy falls to even smaller values of only a few millielectronvolts, which explains their excellent device performance as being due to spontaneous free-carrier generation following light absorption. Additionally, we determine the excitonic reduced effective mass to be 0.104me (where me is the electron mass), significantly smaller than previously estimated experimentally but in good agreement with recent calculations. Our work provides crucial information about the photophysics of these materials, which will in turn allow improved optoelectronic device operation and better understanding of their electronic properties. Direct measurement of the exciton binding energy shows that the impressive performance of perovskite solar cells arises from the spontaneous generation of free electrons and holes after light absorption.

Title: Role of transparency of platinum–ferromagnet interfaces in determining the intrinsic magnitude of the spin Hall effect
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 27 April 2015

Abstract:
The spin Hall effect converts charge current to pure spin currents in orthogonal directions in materials that have significant spin–orbit coupling. The efficiency of the conversion is described by the spin Hall angle (SHA). The SHA can most readily be inferred by using the generated spin currents to excite or rotate the magnetization of ferromagnetic films or nano-elements via spin-transfer torques. Some of the largest spin-torque-derived spin Hall angles (ST-SHA) have been reported in platinum. Here we show, using spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance measurements, that the transparency of the Pt–ferromagnet interface to the spin current plays a central role in determining the magnitude of the ST-SHA. We measure a much larger ST-SHA in Pt/cobalt (∼0.11) compared to Pt/permalloy (∼0.05) bilayers when the interfaces are assumed to be completely transparent. Taking into account the transparency of these interfaces, as derived from spin-mixing conductances, we find that the intrinsic SHA in platinum has a much higher value of 0.19 ± 0.04 as compared to the ST-SHA. The importance of the interface transparency is further exemplified by the insertion of atomically thin magnetic layers at the Pt/permalloy interface that we show strongly modulates the magnitude of the ST-SHA. The spin Hall effect induces spin currents in nonmagnetic layers, which can control the magnetization of neighbouring ferromagnets. The transparency of the interface is shown to strongly influence the efficiency of such manipulation.

Title: Broadband magnetometry and temperature sensing with a light-trapping diamond waveguide
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 06 April 2015

Abstract:
Nitrogen–vacancy centres offer significant promise as nanoscale magnetometers. A light-trapping diamond waveguide is demonstrated, enhancing the temperature and magnetic field sensitivity of such centres by three orders of magnitude. Solid-state quantum sensors are attracting wide interest because of their sensitivity at room temperature. In particular, the spin properties of individual nitrogen–vacancy (NV) colour centres in diamond1,2,3 make them outstanding nanoscale sensors of magnetic fields4,5,6,7,8,9, electric fields10 and temperature11,12,13 under ambient conditions. Recent work on NV ensemble-based magnetometers14,15,16, inertial sensors17, and clocks18 has employed unentangled colour centres to realize significant improvements in sensitivity15,19. However, to achieve this potential sensitivity enhancement in practice, new techniques are required to excite efficiently and to collect the optical signal from large NV ensembles. Here, we introduce a light-trapping diamond waveguide geometry with an excitation efficiency and signal collection that enables in excess of 5% conversion efficiency of pump photons into optically detected magnetic resonance20 (ODMR) fluorescence—an improvement over previous single-pass geometries of more than three orders of magnitude. This marked enhancement of the ODMR signal enables precision broadband measurements of magnetic field and temperature in the low-frequency range, otherwise inaccessible by dynamical decoupling techniques.

Title: Magnetic field effects in hybrid perovskite devices
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 16 March 2015

Abstract:
Magnetic field effects have been a successful tool for studying carrier dynamics in organic semiconductors as the weak spin–orbit coupling in these materials gives rise to long spin relaxation times. As the spin–orbit coupling is strong in organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites, which are promising materials for photovoltaic and light-emitting applications, magnetic field effects are expected to be negligible in these optoelectronic devices. We measured significant magneto-photocurrent, magneto-electroluminescence and magneto-photoluminescence responses in hybrid perovskite devices and thin films, where the amplitude and shape are correlated to each other through the electron–hole lifetime, which depends on the perovskite film morphology. We attribute these responses to magnetic-field-induced spin-mixing of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs with different g-factors—the Δg model. We validate this model by measuring large Δg (∼ 0.65) using field-induced circularly polarized photoluminescence, and electron–hole pair lifetime using picosecond pump–probe spectroscopy. Perovskite photovoltaics are the fastest-advancing solar technology but the mechanisms responsible for their performance are not clear. The observation of magnetic field effects in hybrid perovskites may help to explain their high efficiencies.

Title: Subnanometre-wide electron channels protected by topology
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 02 March 2015

Abstract:
Topologically protected states with a natural helicity are shown to form at step edges, which can be created with subnanometre precision in a weak topological insulator using atomic force microscopy. Helical locking of spin and momentum and prohibited backscattering are the key properties of topologically protected states1,2. They are expected to enable novel types of information processing by providing pure spin currents3,4, or fault tolerant quantum computation by using the Majorana fermions at interfaces of topological states with superconductors5. So far, the required helical conduction channels used to realize Majorana fermions are generated through the application of an axial magnetic field to conventional semiconductor nanowires6. Avoiding the magnetic field enhances the possibilities for circuit design significantly7. Here, we show that subnanometre-wide electron channels with natural helicity are present at surface step edges of the weak topological insulator Bi14Rh3I9 (ref.&nbsp;8). Scanning tunneling spectroscopy reveals the electron channels to be continuous in both energy and space within a large bandgap of 200 meV, evidencing its non-trivial topology. The absence of these channels in the closely related, but topologically trivial compound Bi13Pt3I7 corroborates the channels’ topological nature. The backscatter-free electron channels are a direct consequence of Bi14Rh3I9’s structure: a stack of two-dimensional topologically insulating, graphene-like planes separated by trivial insulators. We demonstrate that the surface of Bi14Rh3I9 can be engraved using an atomic force microscope, allowing networks of protected channels to be patterned with nanometre precision.

Title: Direct observation of Josephson vortex cores
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 23 February 2015

Abstract:
Josephson vortices are circulating supercurrents with an inner structure that is challenging to probe experimentally. Scanning tunnelling microscopy now shows that such vortices contain non-superconducting cores. Superconducting correlations may propagate between two superconductors separated by a tiny insulating or metallic barrier, allowing a dissipationless electric current to flow1,2. In the presence of a magnetic field, the maximum supercurrent oscillates3 and each oscillation corresponding to the entry of one Josephson vortex into the barrier4. Josephson vortices are conceptual blocks of advanced quantum devices such as coherent terahertz generators5 or qubits for quantum computing6, in which on-demand generation and control is crucial. Here, we map superconducting correlations inside proximity Josephson junctions7 using scanning tunnelling microscopy. Unexpectedly, we find that such Josephson vortices have real cores, in which the proximity gap is locally suppressed and the normal state recovered. By following the Josephson vortex formation and evolution we demonstrate that they originate from quantum interference of Andreev quasiparticles8, and that the phase portraits of the two superconducting quantum condensates at edges of the junction decide their generation, shape, spatial extent and arrangement. Our observation opens a pathway towards the generation and control of Josephson vortices by applying supercurrents through the superconducting leads of the junctions, that is, by purely electrical means without any need for a magnetic field, which is a crucial step towards high-density on-chip integration of superconducting quantum devices.

Title: Ultrafast plasmonic nanowire lasers near the surface plasmon frequency
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 28 September 2014

Abstract:
Light–matter interactions are inherently slow as the wavelengths of optical and electronic states differ greatly. Surface plasmon polaritons — electromagnetic excitations at metal–dielectric interfaces — have generated significant interest because their spatial scale is decoupled from the vacuum wavelength, promising accelerated light–matter interactions. Although recent reports suggest the possibility of accelerated dynamics in surface plasmon lasers, this remains to be verified. Here, we report the observation of pulses shorter than 800 fs from hybrid plasmonic zinc oxide (ZnO) nanowire lasers. Operating at room temperature, ZnO excitons lie near the surface plasmon frequency in such silver-based plasmonic lasers, leading to accelerated spontaneous recombination, gain switching and gain recovery compared with conventional ZnO nanowire lasers. Surprisingly, the laser dynamics can be as fast as gain thermalization in ZnO, which precludes lasing in the thinnest nanowires (diameter less than 120 nm). The capability to combine surface plasmon localization with ultrafast amplification provides the means for generating extremely intense optical fields, with applications in sensing, nonlinear optical switching, as well as in the physics of strong-field phenomena. Electron scattering limits the optical excitations produced by metal-based lasers to femtosecond timescales. But sub-picosecond pulsing can be achieved in a plasmonic nanowire laser by operating near the surface plasmon frequency.

Title: Pancake bouncing on superhydrophobic surfaces
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 08 June 2014

Abstract:
When a water drop bounces back from a hydrophobic surface, its initial, spherical shape is usually restored. Now, experiments with a specially engineered superhydrophobic surface made from micrometre-sized tapered pillars covered with copper oxide ‘nanoflowers’ show that droplets can bounce back with a flat, pancake-like shape. Engineering surfaces that promote rapid drop detachment1,2 is of importance to a wide range of applications including anti-icing3,4,5, dropwise condensation6 and self-cleaning7,8,9. Here we show how superhydrophobic surfaces patterned with lattices of submillimetre-scale posts decorated with nanotextures can generate a counter-intuitive bouncing regime: drops spread on impact and then leave the surface in a flattened, pancake shape without retracting. This allows a fourfold reduction in contact time compared with conventional complete rebound 1,10,11,12,13. We demonstrate that the pancake bouncing results from the rectification of capillary energy stored in the penetrated liquid into upward motion adequate to lift the drop. Moreover, the timescales for lateral drop spreading over the surface and for vertical motion must be comparable. In particular, by designing surfaces with tapered micro/nanotextures that behave as harmonic springs, the timescales become independent of the impact velocity, allowing the occurrence of pancake bouncing and rapid drop detachment over a wide range of impact velocities.

Title: Remarkable effects of disorder on superconductivity of single atomic layers of lead on silicon
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 13 April 2014

Abstract:
In bulk materials, superconductivity is remarkably robust with respect to non-magnetic disorder. In the two-dimensional limit, however, disorder and electron correlations both tend to destroy the quantum condensate. Here we study, both experimentally and theoretically, the effect of structural disorder on the local spectral response of crystalline superconducting monolayers of lead on silicon. In a direct scanning tunnelling microscopy measurement, we reveal how the local superconducting spectra lose their conventional character and show variations at scales significantly shorter than the coherence length. We demonstrate that the precise atomic organization determines the robustness of the superconducting order with respect to structural defects, such as single atomic steps, which may disrupt superconductivity and act as native Josephson barriers. We expect that our results will improve the understanding of microscopic processes in surface and interface superconductivity, and will open a new way of engineering atomic-scale superconducting quantum devices. The effect of structural disorder on superconductivity can be subtle: for two crystalline arrangements of superconducting lead monolayers deposited on silicon, there are unexpected spatial variations that result in macroscopically different behaviour.

Title: Real-space tailoring of the electron–phonon coupling in ultraclean nanotube mechanical resonators
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 12 January 2014

Abstract:
The coupling between electrons and phonons is at the heart of many fundamental phenomena in nature. Despite tremendous advances in controlling electrons or phonons in engineered nanosystems, control over their coupling is still widely lacking. Here we demonstrate the ability to fully tailor electron–phonon interactions using a new class of suspended carbon nanotube devices, in which we can form highly tunable single and double quantum dots at arbitrary locations along a nanotube mechanical resonator. We find that electron–phonon coupling can be turned on and off by controlling the position of a quantum dot along the resonator. Using double quantum dots we structure the interactions in real space to couple specific electronic and phononic modes. This tailored coupling allows measurement of the phonons’ spatial parity and imaging of their mode shapes. Finally, we demonstrate coupling between phonons and internal electrons in an isolated system, decoupled from the random environment of the electronic leads, a crucial step towards fully engineered quantum-coherent electron–phonon systems. A mechanism for coupling the electrons and vibrational motion of a suspended carbon nanotube is now demonstrated. Tailoring the coupling between specific electronic and phononic modes by controlling the position of quantum dots along the resonating tube enables spatial imaging of the mode shape.

Being able to sense nuclear spin dimers is an important next step towards single-molecule structural analysis from NMR measurements. Now the sensing of a single 13C–13C nuclear spin dimer near a nitrogen–vacancy centre in diamond is reported, together with a structural characterization at atomic-scale resolution. Single-molecule nuclear magnetic resonance is a current challenge in the field of magnetic resonance spectroscopy and has important applications in chemical analysis and quantum computing. Through decoherence measurements of nitrogen–vacancy centres under dynamical decoupling control, the sensing of a single 13C nuclear spin at nanometre distance has recently been realized1,2,3. A further step towards the ultimate goal of structure analysis of single molecules would be the direct measurement of the interactions within single nuclear-spin clusters4. Here we sense a single 13C–13C nuclear-spin dimer located about 1 nm from the nitrogen–vacancy centre and characterize the interaction (∼690 Hz) between the two nuclear spins. From the measured interaction we derive the spatial configuration of the dimer with atomic-scale resolution. These results indicate that, in combination with advanced material-surface engineering, central spin decoherence under dynamical decoupling control may be a useful probe for nuclear magnetic resonance single-molecule structure analysis.

Title: Coherent optical vortices from relativistic electron beams
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 18 August 2013

Abstract:
The interaction between light and a relativistic electron beam can be used to generate optical vortices in a free electron laser, providing a way to engineer bright orbital angular momentum light at shorter X-ray wavelengths. Recent advances in the production and control of high-brightness electron beams (e-beams) have enabled a new class of intense light sources based on the free electron laser (FEL) that can examine matter at ångstrom length and femtosecond time scales1. The free, or unbound, electrons act as the lasing medium, which provides unique opportunities to exquisitely control the spatial and temporal structure of the emitted light through precision manipulation of the electron distribution. We present an experimental demonstration of light with orbital angular momentum (OAM; ref.&nbsp;2) generated from a relativistic e-beam rearranged into an optical scale helix by a laser. With this technique, we show that a Gaussian laser mode can be effectively up-converted to an OAM mode in an FEL using only the e-beam as a mode-converter. Results confirm theoretical predictions3,4, and pave the way for the production of coherent OAM light with unprecedented brightness down to hard X-ray wavelengths for wide ranging applications in modern light sources.

Title: Production of spin-controlled rare isotope beams
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 21 October 2012

Abstract:
The degree of freedom of spin in quantum systems serves as an unparalleled laboratory where intriguing quantum physical properties can be observed, and the ability to control spin is a powerful tool in physics research. We propose a method for controlling spin in a system of rare isotopes which takes advantage of the mechanism of the projectile fragmentation reaction combined with the momentum-dispersion matching technique. The present method was verified in an experiment at the RIKEN RI Beam Factory, in which a degree of alignment of 8% was achieved for the spin of a rare isotope 32Al. The figure of merit for the present method was found to be greater than that of the conventional method by a factor of more than 50. Enhanced control of the nuclear spin orientation of rare isotopes has now been demonstrated. This technique is considerably more efficient than traditional methods and significantly broadens the domain of accessible nuclei, promising insights in nuclear physics and applications in material science.

Title: Microwave electrometry with Rydberg atoms in a vapour cell using bright atomic resonances
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 16 September 2012

Abstract:
Atom-based standards for length and time as well as other physical quantities such as magnetic fields show clear advantages by enabling stable and uniform measurements. Here we demonstrate a new method for measuring microwave (MW) electric fields based on quantum interference in a rubidium atom. Using a bright resonance prepared within an electromagnetically induced transparency window we could achieve a sensitivity of ∼30 μV cm−1 Hz−1/2 and demonstrate detection of MW electric fields as small as ∼8 μV cm−1 with a modest set-up. The sensitivity is limited, at present, by the stability of our lasers and can be significantly improved in the future. Our method can serve as a new atom-based traceable standard for MW electrometry, with its reproducibility, accuracy and stability promising advances towards levels comparable with those attained in magnetometry at present. Atoms can be used as highly sensitive magnetic-field sensors. By exploiting the effects of electric fields on the optical transitions of excited Rydberg states, it is now demonstrated that it is also possible to probe very weak microwave electric fields with atoms.

Title: Computing prime factors with a Josephson phase qubit quantum processor
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 19 August 2012

Abstract:
Shor’s quantum algorithm factorizes integers, and implementing this is a benchmark test in the early development of quantum processors. Researchers now demonstrate this important test in a solid-state system: a circuit made up of four superconducting qubits factorizes the number 15. A quantum processor can be used to exploit quantum mechanics to find the prime factors of composite numbers1. Compiled versions of Shor’s algorithm and Gauss sum factorizations have been demonstrated on ensemble quantum systems2, photonic systems3,4,5,6 and trapped ions7. Although proposed8, these algorithms have yet to be shown using solid-state quantum bits. Using a number of recent qubit control and hardware advances9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16, here we demonstrate a nine-quantum-element solid-state quantum processor and show three experiments to highlight its capabilities. We begin by characterizing the device with spectroscopy. Next, we produce coherent interactions between five qubits and verify bi- and tripartite entanglement through quantum state tomography10,14,17,18. In the final experiment, we run a three-qubit compiled version of Shor’s algorithm to factor the number 15, and successfully find the prime factors 48% of the time. Improvements in the superconducting qubit coherence times and more complex circuits should provide the resources necessary to factor larger composite numbers and run more intricate quantum algorithms.

Title: Mapping Dirac quasiparticles near a single Coulomb impurity on graphene
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 29 July 2012

Abstract:
In metals, the Coulomb potential of charged impurities is strongly screened, but in graphene, the potential charge of a few-atom cluster of cobalt can extend up to 10 nm. By measuring differences in the way electron-like and hole-like Dirac fermions are scattered from this potential, the intrinsic dielectric constant of graphene can be determined. The response of Dirac fermions to a Coulomb potential is predicted to differ significantly from how non-relativistic electrons behave in traditional atomic and impurity systems1,2,3. Surprisingly, many key theoretical predictions for this ultra-relativistic regime have not been tested4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12. Graphene, a two-dimensional material in which electrons behave like massless Dirac fermions13,14, provides a unique opportunity to test such predictions. Graphene’s response to a Coulomb potential also offers insight into important material characteristics, including graphene’s intrinsic dielectric constant6,8, which is the primary factor determining the strength of electron–electron interactions in graphene15. Here we present a direct measurement of the nanoscale response of Dirac fermions to a single Coulomb potential placed on a gated graphene device. Scanning tunnelling microscopy was used to fabricate tunable charge impurities on graphene, and to image electronic screening around them for a Q = +1|e| charge state. Electron-like and hole-like Dirac fermions were observed to respond differently to a Coulomb potential. Comparing the observed electron–hole asymmetry to theoretical simulations has allowed us to test predictions for how Dirac fermions behave near a Coulomb potential, as well as extract graphene’s intrinsic dielectric constant: ɛg = 3.0±1.0. This small value of ɛg indicates that electron–electron interactions can contribute significantly to graphene properties.

Title: Efficient and long-lived quantum memory with cold atoms inside a ring cavity
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 20 May 2012

Abstract:
A quantum memory that combines high-efficiency and long lifetime is now demonstrated. Employing a collective excitation, or spin wave, in an ensemble of atoms in a trap improves memory lifetime, while incorporating the trap into an optical ring cavity simultaneously aids higher retrieval efficiency. Quantum memories are regarded as one of the fundamental building blocks of linear-optical quantum computation1 and long-distance quantum communication2. A long-standing goal to realize scalable quantum information processing is to build a long-lived and efficient quantum memory. There have been significant efforts distributed towards this goal. However, either efficient but short-lived3,4 or long-lived but inefficient quantum memories5,6,7 have been demonstrated so far. Here we report a high-performance quantum memory in which long lifetime and high retrieval efficiency meet for the first time. By placing a ring cavity around an atomic ensemble, employing a pair of clock states, creating a long-wavelength spin wave and arranging the set-up in the gravitational direction, we realize a quantum memory with an intrinsic spin wave to photon conversion efficiency of 73(2)% together with a storage lifetime of 3.2(1) ms. This realization provides an essential tool towards scalable linear-optical quantum information processing.

Title: Spin-nematic squeezed vacuum in a quantum gas
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 26 February 2012

Abstract:
Squeezed states—which permit precision beyond the scope of Heisenberg’s uncertainty relation—are well established for spin-1/2 particles. Now an elegant demonstration of squeezing in spin-1 condensates generalizes the criteria for squeezed states to higher spin dimensions. The standard quantum limit of measurement uncertainty can be surpassed using squeezed states, which minimize the uncertainty product in Heisenberg’s relation by reducing the uncertainty of one property at the expense of another1. Collisions in ultracold atomic gases have been used to induce quadrature spin squeezing in two-component Bose condensates 2,3, for which the complementary properties are the components of the total spin vector. Here, we generalize this finding to a higher-dimensional spin space by measuring squeezing in a spin-1 Bose condensate. Following a quench through a quantum phase transition, we demonstrate that spin-nematic quadrature squeezing improves on the standard quantum limit by up to 8–10 dB—a significant increase on previous measurements. This squeezing is associated with negligible occupation of the squeezed modes, and is analogous to optical two-mode vacuum squeezing. The observation has implications for continuous variable quantum information and quantum-enhanced magnetometry.

Title: Focusing of short-pulse high-intensity laser-accelerated proton beams
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 04 December 2011

Abstract:
When an intense laser pulse hits a flat metal foil, it ejects a spray of high-energy protons. Laser irradiation of a curved foil covering the tip of a hollow cone focuses the protons to intensities that could be useful for generating extreme states of matter. Recent progress in generating high-energy (&gt;50 MeV) protons from intense laser–matter interactions (1018–1021 W cm−2; refs&nbsp;1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) has opened up new areas of research, with applications in radiography8, oncology9, astrophysics10, medical imaging11, high-energy-density physics12,13,14, and ion-proton beam fast ignition15,16,17,18,19. With the discovery of proton focusing with curved surfaces20,21, rapid advances in these areas will be driven by improved focusing technologies. Here we report on the first investigation of the generation and focusing of a proton beam using a cone-shaped target. We clearly show that the focusing is strongly affected by the electric fields in the beam in both open and enclosed (cone) geometries, bending the trajectories near the axis. Also in the cone geometry, a sheath electric field effectively ‘channels’ the proton beam through the cone tip, substantially improving the beam focusing properties. These results agree well with particle simulations and provide the physics basis for many future applications.

Title: Observation of an electrically tunable band gap in trilayer graphene
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 25 September 2011

Abstract:
Monolayer graphene has no electronic band gap. Bilayer graphene does, and can be controlled by an electric field. And for trilayer graphene, infrared transmission measurements indicate both situations are possible depending on the stacking of the layers. A striking feature of bilayer graphene is the induction of a significant band gap in the electronic states by the application of a perpendicular electric field1,2,3,4,5,6,7. Thicker graphene layers are also highly attractive materials. The ability to produce a band gap in these systems is of great fundamental and practical interest. Both experimental8 and theoretical9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16 investigations of graphene trilayers with the typical ABA layer stacking have, however, revealed the lack of any appreciable induced gap. Here we contrast this behaviour with that exhibited by graphene trilayers with ABC crystallographic stacking. The symmetry of this structure is similar to that of AB-stacked graphene bilayers and, as shown by infrared conductivity measurements, permits a large band gap to be formed by an applied electric field. Our results demonstrate the critical and hitherto neglected role of the crystallographic stacking sequence on the induction of a band gap in few-layer graphene.

Title: Strong back-action of a linear circuit on a single electronic quantum channel
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 18 September 2011

Abstract:
At the nanoscale, the conductance of a coherent conductor is reduced by the back-action of the circuit in which it is inserted. The effect has been primarily studied for cases where it is small, but these authors explore the regime of strong back-action—with conductance reductions of up to 90%—and propose a generalized expression for the conductance of quantum channels embedded in linear circuits. The question of which laws govern electricity in mesoscopic circuitsis a fundamental matter that also has direct implications for the quantum engineering of nanoelectronic devices. When a quantum-coherent conductor is inserted into a circuit, its transport properties are modified; in particular, its conductance is reduced because of the circuit back-action. This phenomenon, known as environmental Coulomb blockade, results from the granularity of charge transfers across the coherent conductor1. Although extensively studied for a tunnel junction in a linear circuit2,3,4,5, it is only fully understood for arbitrary short coherent conductors in the limit of small circuit impedances and small conductance reduction6,7,8. Here, we investigate experimentally the strong-back-action regime, with a conductance reduction of up to 90%. This is achieved by embedding a single quantum channel of tunable transmission in an adjustable on-chip circuit of impedance comparable to the resistance quantum RK = h/e2 at microwave frequencies. The experiment reveals significant deviations from calculations performed in the weak back-action framework6,7, and is in agreement with recent theoretical results9,10. Based on these measurements, we propose a generalized expression for the conductance of an arbitrary quantum channel embedded in a linear circuit.

Title: Visualizing the local optical response to extreme-ultraviolet radiation with a resolution of λ/380
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 17 July 2011

Abstract:
Conventionally, the smallest object you can see with light at a certain wavelength λ is about λ/2 in size. Researchers have now broken this wavelength–resolution link. Combining ultraviolet and X-ray photons in a nonlinear process enabled the optical properties of diamond to be mapped down to a resolution of λ/380. Scientists have continually tried to improve the spatial resolution of imaging ever since the invention of the optical microscope in around 1610 by Galileo1. Recently, a spatial resolution near λ/10 was achieved in a near-field scheme by using surface plasmon polaritons2,3. However, further improvement in this direction is hindered by the size of metallic nanostructures2. Here we show that atom-scale resolution is achievable in the extreme-ultraviolet region by using X-ray parametric down-conversion, which detaches the achievable resolution from the wavelength of the probe light. We visualize three-dimensionally the local optical response of diamond at wavelengths between 103 and 206 Å&nbsp;with a resolution as fine as 0.54 Å. This corresponds to a resolution from λ/190 to λ/380, an order of magnitude better than ever achieved. Although the present study focuses on the relatively high-energy optical regions, our method could be extended into the visible region using advanced X-ray sources4,5,6,7, and would open a new window into the optical properties of solids.

Title: Unconditional room-temperature quantum memory
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 12 June 2011

Abstract:
Just as classical information systems require buffers and memory, the same is true for quantum information systems. The potential that optical quantum information processing holds for revolutionizing computation and communication is therefore driving significant research into developing optical quantum memory. A practical optical quantum memory must be able to store and recall quantum states on demand with high efficiency and low noise. Ideally, the platform for the memory would also be simple and inexpensive. Here, we present a complete tomographic reconstruction of quantum states that have been stored in the ground states of rubidium in a vapour cell operating at around 80 °C. Without conditional measurements, we show recall fidelity up to 98% for coherent pulses containing around one photon. To unambiguously verify that our memory beats the quantum no-cloning limit we employ state-independent verification using conditional variance and signal-transfer coefficients. Optical quantum memories—storage devices for the data encoded in light pulses—will be vital for buffering the flow of quantum information. Researchers now demonstrate such a device that can operate at room temperature. The quantum state is stored in a vapour of rubidium atoms and then recalled with a fidelity in excess of 98%.

Title: Confinement of antihydrogen for 1,000 seconds
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 05 June 2011

Abstract:
Atoms made of a particle and an antiparticle are unstable, usually surviving less than a microsecond. Antihydrogen, made entirely of antiparticles, is believed to be stable, and it is this longevity that holds the promise of precision studies of matter–antimatter symmetry. We have recently demonstrated trapping of antihydrogen atoms by releasing them after a confinement time of 172 ms. A critical question for future studies is: how long can anti-atoms be trapped? Here, we report the observation of anti-atom confinement for 1,000 s, extending our earlier results by nearly four orders of magnitude. Our calculations indicate that most of the trapped anti-atoms reach the ground state. Further, we report the first measurement of the energy distribution of trapped antihydrogen, which, coupled with detailed comparisons with simulations, provides a key tool for the systematic investigation of trapping dynamics. These advances open up a range of experimental possibilities, including precision studies of charge–parity–time reversal symmetry and cooling to temperatures where gravitational effects could become apparent. Antihydrogen has been created, trapped and stored for 1,000 s. The improved holding time means that we now have access to the ground state of antimatter—long enough to test whether matter and antimatter obey the same physical laws.

Title: Floquet topological insulator in semiconductor quantum wells
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 13 March 2011

Abstract:
Topological phases of matter have captured our imagination over the past few years, with tantalizing properties such as robust edge modes and exotic non-Abelian excitations, and potential applications ranging from semiconductor spintronics to topological quantum computation. Despite recent advancements in the field, our ability to control topological transitions remains limited, and usually requires changing material or structural properties. We show, using Floquet theory, that a topological state can be induced in a semiconductor quantum well, initially in the trivial phase. This can be achieved by irradiation with microwave frequencies, without changing the well structure, closing the gap and crossing the phase transition. We show that the quasi-energy spectrum exhibits a single pair of helical edge states. We discuss the necessary experimental parameters for our proposal. This proposal provides an example and a proof of principle of a new non-equilibrium topological state, the Floquet topological insulator, introduced in this paper. The ability to switch a semiconductor into a topological insulator would produce topological states on demand. Applying a time-dependent field to well-studied semiconductor quantum wells may lead to this kind of control.

Title: Piezoresistive heat engine and refrigerator
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 16 January 2011

Abstract:
Heat engines provide most of our mechanical power and are essential for transportation on the macroscopic scale. However, although significant progress has been made in the miniaturization of electrostatic engines, it has proved difficult to reduce the size of liquid- or gas-driven heat engines below 107 μm3. Here we demonstrate that a crystalline silicon structure operates as a cyclic piezoresistive heat engine when it is driven by a sufficiently high d.c. current. A 0.34 μm3 engine beam draws heat from the d.c. current using the piezoresistive effect and converts it into mechanical work by expansion and contraction at different temperatures. This mechanical power drives a silicon resonator of 1.1×103 μm3 into sustained oscillation. Even below the oscillation threshold the engine beam continues to amplify the resonator’s Brownian motion. When its thermodynamic cycle is inverted, the structure is shown to reduce these thermal fluctuations, therefore operating as a refrigerator. A micrometre-scale device that exploits the piezoresistive characteristics of silicon acts like an engine, converting heat into mechanical work in one mode of operation, and, in another, like a refrigerator, suppressing mechanical fluctuations.

Title: Few femtosecond, few kiloampere electron bunch produced by a laser–plasma accelerator

Date: 09 January 2011

Abstract:
A demonstration of the use of laser-driven plasma accelerators to generate electron beams having sharp temporal features of durations approaching 1 femtosecond, and currents of 3–4 kiloamperes, improves the outlook for using these devices in the development of compact free-electron lasers Particle accelerators driven by the interaction of ultraintense and ultrashort laser pulses with a plasma1 can generate accelerating electric fields of several hundred gigavolts per metre and deliver high-quality electron beams with low energy spread2,3,4,5, low emittance6 and up to 1 GeV peak energy7,8. Moreover, it is expected they may soon be able to produce bursts of electrons shorter than those produced by conventional particle accelerators, down to femtosecond durations and less. Here we present wide-band spectral measurements of coherent transition radiation which we use for temporal characterization. Our analysis shows that the electron beam, produced using controlled optical injection9, contains a temporal feature that can be identified as a 15 pC, 1.4–1.8 fs electron bunch (root mean square) leading to a peak current of 3–4 kA depending on the bunch shape. We anticipate that these results will have a strong impact on emerging applications such as short-pulse and short-wavelength radiation sources10,11, and will benefit the realization of laboratory-scale free-electron lasers12,13,14.

Title: A topological insulator surface under strong Coulomb, magnetic and disorder perturbations
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 12 December 2010

Abstract:
Topological insulators are bulk insulators beneath conducting surface states with very special properties. By doping these surface states with iron, the surface band structure can be explored and controlled. Topological insulators embody a state of bulk matter characterizedby spin-momentum-locked surface states that span the bulk bandgap1,2,3,4,5,6,7. This highly unusual surface spin environment provides a rich ground for uncovering new phenomena 4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24. Understanding the response of a topological surface to strong Coulomb perturbations represents a frontier in discovering the interacting and emergent many-body physics of topological surfaces. Here we present the first controlled study of topological insulator surfaces under Coulomb and magnetic perturbations. We have used time-resolved deposition of iron, with a large Coulomb charge and significant magnetic moment, to systematically modify the topological spin structure of the Bi2Se3 surface. We observe that such perturbation leads to the creation of odd multiples of Dirac fermions and that magnetic interactions break time-reversal symmetry in the presence of band hybridizations. We present a theoretical model to account for the observed electron dynamics of the topological surface. Taken collectively, these results are a critical guide in controlling electron mobility and quantum behaviour of topological surfaces, not only for device applications but also in setting the stage for creating exotic particles such as axions or imaging monopoles on the surface.

Title: A 1.8-THz quantum cascade laser operating significantly above the temperature of ℏω/kB
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 12 December 2010

Abstract:
Several competing technologies continue to advance the field of terahertz science; of particular importance has been the development of a terahertz semiconductor quantum cascade laser (QCL), which is arguably the only solid-state terahertz source with average optical power levels of much greater than a milliwatt. Terahertz QCLs are required to be cryogenically cooled and improvement of their temperature performance is the single most important research goal in the field. Thus far, their maximum operating temperature has been empirically limited to ∼ℏω/kB, a largely inexplicable trend that has bred speculation that a room-temperature terahertz QCL may not be possible in materials used at present. Here, we argue that this behaviour is an indirect consequence of the resonant-tunnelling injection mechanism employed in all previously reported terahertz QCLs. We demonstrate a new scattering-assisted injection scheme to surpass this limit for a 1.8-THz QCL that operates up to ∼1.9ℏω/kB (163 K). Peak optical power in excess of 2 mW was detected from the laser at 155 K. This development should make QCL technology attractive for applications below 2 THz, and initiate new design strategies for realizing a room-temperature terahertz semiconductor laser. Quantum cascade lasers can operate at terahertz frequencies because they use intraband, rather than interband, transitions in semiconductor nanostructures. However, they seemed to have reached a ceiling in terms of maximum operating temperature. This trend has now been broken with the introduction of a new scheme for charge injection.

Title: Thermal ground-state ordering and elementary excitations in artificial magnetic square ice
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 28 November 2010

Abstract:
Recent advances in nanotechnology allow model systems to be constructed, in which frustrated interactions can be tuned at will, such as artificial spin ice. The symmetry of the square ice lattice leads to the emergence of a long-range-ordered ground state from the manifold of frustrated states. However, it is experimentally very difficult to access using the effective thermodynamics of rotating-field demagnetization protocols, because the energy barriers to thermal equilibrium are extremely large. Here we study an as-fabricated sample that approaches the ground state very closely. We identify the small localized departures from the ground state as elementary excitations of the system, at frequencies that follow a Boltzmann law. We therefore identify the state we observe as the frozen-in residue of true thermodynamics that occurred during the fabrication of the sample. The relative proportions of different excitations are suggestive of monopole interactions during thermalization. Simply cooling down an artificial spin-ice does not necessarily lead to ground-state magnetic order. But as-grown artificial square ice reaches a thermodynamic ground state, with monopole dynamics possibly involved in the thermalization.

Title: Quantum memory for entangled continuous-variable states
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 07 November 2010

Abstract:
Quantum information is often thought of in terms of manipulating discrete qubits. But continuous variables can also carry data. A method for storing continuous-variable states of light for up to a millisecond in room-temperature memories is now demonstrated. A quantum memory for light is a key element for the realization of future quantum information networks1,2,3. Requirements for a good quantum memory are versatility (allowing a wide range of inputs) and preservation of quantum information in a way unattainable with any classical memory device. Here we demonstrate such a quantum memory for continuous-variable entangled states, which play a fundamental role in quantum information processing4,5,6. We store an extensive alphabet of two-mode 6.0 dB squeezed states obtained by varying the orientation of squeezing and the displacement of the states. The two components of the entangled state are stored in two room-temperature cells separated by 0.5 m, one for each mode, with a memory time of 1 ms. The true quantum character of the memory is rigorously proved by showing that the experimental memory fidelity 0.52±0.02 significantly exceeds the benchmark of 0.45 for the best possible classical memory for a range of displacements.

Title: Heralded single-photon absorption by a single atom
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 24 October 2010

Abstract:
The absorption of one photon of an entangled pair by a lone trapped atom is identified by a correlation between the atomic absorption process and the detection of the second photon. Emission and absorption of single photons by single atoms is a fundamental limit of matter–light interaction, manifesting its quantum mechanical nature. As a controlled process, it is also a key tool in quantum optical information technology 1,2,3. Controlled single-photon emission is well advanced 4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14; for controlled single-photon absorption by a single atom, proposals exist but only preliminary experimental steps have been taken 15,16,17,18,19. Here we report the absorption of single photons by a single trapped ion: employing a photon pair source, detection of the quantum-correlated partner photon heralds the presence of the resonant photon at the atom. We find clear correlations between the detection of the herald and the absorption process in the atom; we also demonstrate polarization control of this process. Our experiment evidences previously unexplored interaction between a single absorber and a quantum light source; with improved control over the coupling, it will open up new avenues in quantum technology.

Title: Trionic optical potential for electrons in semiconductors
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 26 September 2010

Abstract:
Laser-induced optical potentials for atoms have led to remarkable advances in precision measurement, quantum information and towards addressing fundamental questions in condensed-matter physics. Here, we describe analogous optical potentials for electrons in quantum wells and wires that can be generated by optically driving the transition between a single electron and a three-body electron–exciton bound state, known as a trion. The existence of a bound trion state adds a term to the a.c. Stark shift of the material proportional to the light intensity at the position of the electron. According to our theoretical calculations, this shift can be large relative to the thermal equilibrium temperature of the electron, resulting in a relatively strong optical potential that could be used to trap, guide and manipulate individual electrons within a semiconductor quantum well or wire. These potentials can be thought of as artificial nanostructures on the scale of 100 nm that can be spin dependent and reconfigurable in real time. Our results suggest the possibility of integrating ultrafast optics and gate voltages in new resolved-carrier semiconductor optoelectronic devices, with potential applications in fields such as nanoelectronics, spintronics and quantum information processing. The energy potentials created by laser light can trap atoms. An analogous effect that traps electrons in solid-state systems is now proposed. The electron traps are created in quantum wells and wires in the presence of quasiparticles composed of two electrons and a hole. The idea could lead to advances in ultrafast optical and new optoelectronic devices.

Title: Near-deterministic preparation of a single atom in an optical microtrap
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 26 September 2010

Abstract:
Loading only single atoms into an optical trap with an efficiency in excess of 80% has now been achieved by manipulating the collisions between pairs of atoms. Such a process has previously been limited to about 50% efficiency. The technique will aid the development of neutral-atom-based quantum logic gates. Neutral atoms stored in optical traps are strong candidates for a physical realization of a quantum logic device1,2. Far off-resonance optical traps provide conservative potentials and excellent isolation from the environment, and they may be arranged to produce arbitrary arrays of traps, where each trap is occupied by a single atom that can be individually addressed3,4,5,6. At present, significant effort is being expended on developing two-qubit gates based on coupling individual Rydberg atoms in adjacent optical microtraps7,8,9. A major challenge associated with this approach is the reliable generation of single-atom occupancy in each trap, as the loading efficiency in the past experiments has been limited to 50% (refs&nbsp;4, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12). Here we report a loading efficiency of 82.7% in an optical microtrap. We achieve this by manipulating the collisions between pairs of trapped atoms through tailored optical fields and directly observing the resulting single atoms in the trap.

Title: Zernike phase contrast in scanning microscopy with X-rays
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 12 September 2010

Abstract:
Introducing a phase shift between diffracted and undiffracted light from a sample is one of the oldest techniques for generating phase contrast in optical microscopy. A similar approach should help improve the contrast and clarity of images collected by scanning X-ray microscopy. Scanning X-ray microscopy focuses radiation to a small spot and probes the sample by raster scanning. It allows information to be obtained from secondary signals such as X-ray fluorescence, which yields an elemental mapping of the sample not available in full-field imaging. The analysis and interpretation from these secondary signals can be considerably enhanced if these data are coupled with structural information from transmission imaging. However, absorption often is negligible and phase contrast has not been easily available. Originally introduced with visible light, Zernike phase contrast1 is a well-established technique in full-field X-ray microscopes for visualization of weakly absorbing samples2,3,4,5,6,7. On the basis of reciprocity, we demonstrate the implementation of Zernike phase contrast in scanning X-ray microscopy, revealing structural detail simultaneously with hard-X-ray trace-element measurements. The method is straightforward to implement without significant influence on the resolution of the fluorescence images and delivers complementary information. We show images of biological specimens that clearly demonstrate the advantage of correlating morphology with elemental information.

Title: Strong and tunable nonlinear optomechanical coupling in a low-loss system
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 27 June 2010

Abstract:
A major goal in optomechanics is to observe and control quantum behaviour in a system consisting of a mechanical resonator coupled to an optical cavity. Work towards this goal has focused on increasing the strength of the coupling between the mechanical and optical degrees of freedom. However, the form of this coupling is crucial in determining which phenomena can be observed in such a system. Here we demonstrate that avoided crossings in the spectrum of an optical cavity containing a flexible dielectric membrane enable us to realize several different forms of the optomechanical coupling. These include cavity detunings that are (to lowest order) linear, quadratic or quartic in the membrane’s displacement, and a cavity finesse that is linear in (or independent of) the membrane’s displacement. All these couplings are realized in a single device with extremely low optical loss and can be tuned over a wide range in situ. In particular, we find that the quadratic coupling can be increased three orders of magnitude beyond previous devices. As a result of these advances, the device presented here should be capable of demonstrating the quantization of the membrane’s mechanical energy. An optical cavity coupled to a micrometre-sized mechanical resonator offers the opportunity to see quantum effects in relatively large structures. It is now shown that a variety of coupling mechanisms enable investigation of these fascinating systems in a number of different ways.

Title: Detecting the orientation of magnetic fields in galaxy clusters
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 16 May 2010

Abstract:
Clusters of galaxies, filled with hot magnetized plasma, are the largest bound objects in existence and an important touchstone in understanding the formation of structures in our Universe. In such clusters, thermal conduction follows field lines, so magnetic fields strongly shape the cluster’s thermal history; that some have not since cooled and collapsed is a mystery. In a seemingly unrelated puzzle, recent observations of Virgo cluster spiral galaxies imply ridges of strong, coherent magnetic fields offset from their centre. Here we demonstrate, using three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical simulations, that such ridges are easily explained by galaxies sweeping up field lines as they orbit inside the cluster. This magnetic drape is then lit up with cosmic rays from the galaxies’ stars, generating coherent polarized emission at the galaxies’ leading edges. This immediately presents a technique for probing local orientations and characteristic length scales of cluster magnetic fields. The first application of this technique, mapping the field of the Virgo cluster, gives a startling result: outside a central region, the magnetic field is preferentially oriented radially as predicted by the magnetothermal instability. Our results strongly suggest a mechanism for maintaining some clusters in a ‘non-cooling-core’&nbsp;state. Large clusters of galaxies are cosmologically significant, and their thermal history is determined by magnetic fields. Simulations show that the magnetic-field lines in the Virgo cluster, rather surprisingly, are oriented radially. This would explain the observed ridged structure. Moreover, the model may explain why some clusters have not cooled as expected.

Title: A Rydberg quantum simulator
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 14 March 2010

Abstract:
A universal quantum simulator is a controlled quantum device that reproduces the dynamics of any other many-particle quantum system with short-range interactions. This dynamics can refer to both coherent Hamiltonian and dissipative open-system evolution. Here we propose that laser-excited Rydberg atoms in large-spacing optical or magnetic lattices provide an efficient implementation of a universal quantum simulator for spin models involving n-body interactions, including such of higher order. This would allow the simulation of Hamiltonians of exotic spin models involving n-particle constraints, such as the Kitaev toric code, colour code and lattice gauge theories with spin-liquid phases. In addition, our approach provides the ingredients for dissipative preparation of entangled states based on engineering n-particle reservoir couplings. The basic building blocks of our architecture are efficient and high-fidelity n-qubit entangling gates using auxiliary Rydberg atoms, including a possible dissipative time step through optical pumping. This enables mimicking the time evolution of the system by a sequence of fast, parallel and high-fidelity n-particle coherent and dissipative Rydberg gates. Building on recent experimental advances in controlling individual Rydberg atoms, theoretical work proposes a ‘Rydberg quantum simulator’. Such a system would be suitable for efficiently simulating other quantum systems with many-body interactions and strongly correlated ground states.

Title: Superconducting quantum interference proximity transistor
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 28 February 2010

Abstract:
The development of superconducting quantum interference devices based on the Josephson effect has led to significant improvements in our ability to measure magnetic fields. A similar device, dubbed the superconducting quantum interference transistor, which exploits the proximity effect, could allow similar significant further improvements. When a superconductor is placed close to a non-superconducting metal, it can induce superconducting correlations in the metal 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10, known as the ‘proximity effect’11. Such behaviour modifies the density of states (DOS) in the normal metal12,13,14,15 and opens a minigap12,13,16 with an amplitude that can be controlled by changing the phase of the superconducting order parameter12,15. Here, we exploit such behaviour to realize a new type of interferometer, the superconducting quantum interference proximity transistor (SQUIPT), for which the operation relies on the modulation with the magnetic field of the DOS of a proximized metal embedded in a superconducting loop. Even without optimizing its design, this device shows extremely low flux noise, down to ∼10−5 Φ0Hz−1/2 (Φ0≃2×10−15 Wb is the flux quantum) and dissipation several orders of magnitude smaller than in conventional superconducting interferometers17,18,19. With optimization, the SQUIPT could significantly increase the sensitivity with which small magnetic moments are detected.

Title: Bias-voltage dependence of perpendicular spin-transfer torque in asymmetric MgO-based magnetic tunnel junctions
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 25 October 2009

Abstract:
Spin-transfer torque allows the magnetization of nanopillar devices to be switched electrically. Incorporating asymmetries into the design of such a device generates a linear out-of-plane torque component that could help prevent the unwanted spontaneous reversal of the nanopillar’s magnetization. Spin-transfer torque1,2 (STT) allows the electrical control of magnetic states in nanostructures3,4,5. The STT in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) is of particular importance owing to its potential for device applications6,7. It has been demonstrated8,9,10,11 that the MTJ has a sizable perpendicular STT ( , field-like torque), which substantially affects STT-driven magnetization dynamics. In contrast to symmetric MTJs where the bias dependence of is quadratic8,9,10,12,13, it is theoretically predicted that the symmetry breaking of the system causes an extra linear bias dependence11. Here, we report experimental results that are consistent with the predicted linear bias dependence in asymmetric MTJs. The linear contribution is quite significant and its sign changes from positive to negative as the asymmetry is modified. This result opens a way to design the bias dependence of the field-like term, which is useful for device applications by allowing, in particular, the suppression of the abnormal switching-back phenomena.

Title: Anisotropic magneto-Coulomb effects and magnetic single-electron-transistor action in a single nanoparticle
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 18 October 2009

Abstract:
A present challenge in the field of spintronics is the study of spin-dependent transport in nanodevices where all dimensions are reduced to only a few nanometres. The archetypical device structure used to explore spin transport at such a scale consists of a nanometre-sized object such as a molecule, quantum dot or nanotube connected by ferromagnetic contacts. New magneto-Coulomb effects are expected as a consequence of the interaction between charge and spin degrees of freedom. However, the focus has been mainly theoretical up to now with a lack of results on the experimental side. More importantly, in most of the studies the influence of the ferromagnetic electrodes has been largely overlooked. Here, we demonstrate that a significant magneto-Coulomb effect can be induced by conventional magnetic electrodes and mimic spin-valve magnetoresistance. Moreover, we show that the magnetic electrode can act as a gate leading to a ferromagnetic single-electron transistor with only two terminals. Anisotropies in the response of ferromagnetic electrodes attached to a gold nanoparticle lead to Coulomb blockade and spin-valve-like magnetoresistance phenomena. Such behaviour could allow the development of magnetically gated single-electron transistors composed of just two terminals.

Title: Spin-resolved quantum interference in graphene
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 11 October 2009

Abstract:
Graphene is expected to possess characteristics that are particularly useful for transporting and manipulating electronic spin. The discovery of spin-dependent interference features in its electrical characteristics could be useful in the development of graphene spintronics. The unusual electronic properties of single-layer graphene1 make it a promising materials system for fundamental advances in physics, and an attractive platform for new device technologies. Graphene’s spin-transport properties are expected to be particularly interesting, with predictions for extremely long coherence times and intrinsic spin-polarized states at zero field2,3,4,5. To test such predictions, it is necessary to measure the spin polarization of electrical currents in graphene. Here, we resolve spin transport directly from conductance features that are caused by quantum interference. These features split visibly in an in-plane magnetic field, similar to Zeeman splitting in atomic and quantum-dot systems6,7. The spin-polarized conductance features that are the subject of this work may, in the future, lead to the development of graphene devices incorporating interference-based spin filters.

Title: Broken-symmetry states and divergent resistance in suspended bilayer graphene
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 27 September 2009

Abstract:
The presence of disorder makes it difficult to determine the intrinsic properties of graphene in its ideal form. Measurements of high-quality bilayer graphene flakes suspended above a substrate identify the persistence of quantum Hall behaviour at magnetic fields an order of magnitude lower than seen before, and previously unseen symmetry breaking of the lowest Landau level is also observed. Mono- and bilayer graphene have generated tremendous excitement owing to their unique and potentially useful electronic properties1. Suspending single-layer graphene flakes above the substrate2,3 has been shown to greatly improve sample quality, yielding high-mobility devices with little charge inhomogeneity. Here we report the fabrication of suspended bilayer graphene devices with very little disorder. We observe quantum Hall states that are fully quantized at a magnetic field of 0.2 T, as well as broken-symmetry states at intermediate filling factors ν=0, ±1, ±2 and ±3. In the ν=0 state, the devices show extremely high magnetoresistance that scales as magnetic field divided by temperature. This resistance is predominantly affected by the perpendicular component of the applied field, and the extracted energy gap is significantly larger than expected for Zeeman splitting. These findings indicate that the broken-symmetry states arise from many-body interactions and underscore the important part that Coulomb interactions play in bilayer graphene.

Title: Vacuum-ultraviolet frequency combs from below-threshold harmonics
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 20 September 2009

Abstract:
Frequency combs have revolutionized frequency metrology. High-harmonic generation in atoms has led to fast sources of short-wavelength photons. Combining these two technologies enables the transfer of frequency combs to the vacuum-ultraviolet with potential applications in spectroscopy. Recent demonstrations of high-harmonic generation (HHG) at very high repetition frequencies (∼100 MHz) may allow for the revolutionary transfer of frequency combs to the vacuum-ultraviolet range. This advance necessitates unifying optical frequency-comb technology with strong-field atomic physics. Whereas strong-field studies of HHG have often focused on above-threshold harmonic generation (photon energy above the ionization potential), for vacuum-ultraviolet frequency combs an understanding of below-threshold harmonic orders and their generation process is crucial. Here, we present a new and quantitative study of the harmonics 7–13 generated below and near the ionization threshold in xenon gas with an intense 1,070 nm driving field. We show multiple generation pathways for these harmonics that are manifested as on-axis interference in the harmonic yield. This discovery provides a new understanding of the strong-field, below-threshold dynamics under the influence of an atomic potential and allows us to quantitatively assess the achievable coherence of a vacuum-ultraviolet frequency comb generated through below-threshold harmonics. We find that under reasonable experimental conditions, temporal coherence is maintained. As evidence, we present the first explicit vacuum-ultraviolet frequency-comb structure beyond the third harmonic.

Title: Assessment of carrier-multiplication efficiency in bulk PbSe and PbS
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 06 September 2009

Abstract:
More efficient solar-energy conversion is possible if a single high-energy photon can be made to generate two electron–hole pairs in a cell, rather than a single pair plus heat. It is now shown that, contrary to expectation, this carrier multiplication is better in bulk semiconductor materials than in quantum dots. One of the important factors limiting solar-cell efficiency is that incident photons generate one electron–hole pair, irrespective of the photon energy. Any excess photon energy is lost as heat. The possible generation of multiple charge carriers per photon (carrier multiplication) is therefore of great interest for future solar cells1. Carrier multiplication is known to occur in bulk semiconductors, but has been thought to be enhanced significantly in nanocrystalline materials such as quantum dots, owing to their discrete energy levels and enhanced Coulomb interactions1,2,3. Contrary to this expectation, we demonstrate here that, for a given photon energy, carrier multiplication occurs more efficiently in bulk PbS and PbSe than in quantum dots of the same materials. Measured carrier-multiplication efficiencies in bulk materials are reproduced quantitatively using tight-binding calculations, which indicate that the reduced carrier-multiplication efficiency in quantum dots can be ascribed to the reduced density of states in these structures.

Title: Elimination, reversal and directional bias of optical diffraction
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 02 August 2009

Abstract:
Electromagnetically induced transparency in an atomic gas can slow the propagation of images. It is now shown that the diffraction of such images as they propagate can be controlled and even eliminated. This is achieved by using atomic diffusion to influence the spreading of the image. Any image, imprinted on a wave field and propagating in free space, undergoes a paraxial diffraction spreading. The reduction or manipulation of diffraction is desirable for many applications, such as imaging, wave-guiding, microlithography and optical data processing. As was recently demonstrated, arbitrary images imprinted on light pulses are dramatically slowed1,2 when traversing an atomic medium of electromagnetically induced transparency3,4 and undergo diffusion due to the thermal atomic motion5,6. Here we experimentally demonstrate a new technique to eliminate the paraxial diffraction and the diffusion of slow light, regardless of its position and shape7. Unlike former suggestions for diffraction manipulation8,9,10,11,12, our scheme is linear and operates in the wavevector space, eliminating the diffraction for arbitrary images throughout their propagation. By tuning the interaction, we further demonstrate acceleration of diffraction, biased diffraction and induced deflection, and reverse diffraction, implementing a negative-diffraction lens13. Alongside recent advances in slow-light amplification14 and image entanglement15, diffraction control opens various possibilities for classical and quantum image manipulation.

Title: Realization of collective strong coupling with ion Coulomb crystals in an optical cavity
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 07 June 2009

Abstract:
The experimental realization of strong coupling between a Coulomb crystal—made of several hundred ions—and the light field in an optical cavity could provide a route to efficient light–matter interfaces. Cavity quantum electrodynamics (CQED) focuses on understanding the interactions between matter and the electromagnetic field in cavities at the quantum level1,2. In the past years, CQED has attracted attention3,4,5,6,7,8,9 especially owing to its importance for the field of quantum information10. At present, photons are the best carriers of quantum information between physically separated sites11,12 and quantum-information processing using stationary qubits10 is most promising, with the furthest advances having been made with trapped ions13,14,15. The implementation of complex quantum-information-processing networks11,12 hence requires devices to efficiently couple photons and stationary qubits. Here, we present the first CQED experiments demonstrating that the collective strong-coupling regime2 can be reached in the interaction between a solid in the form of an ion Coulomb crystal16 and an optical field. The obtained coherence times are in the millisecond range and indicate that Coulomb crystals positioned inside optical cavities are promising for realizing a variety of quantum-information devices, including quantum repeaters12 and quantum memories for light17,18. Moreover, cavity optomechanics19 using Coulomb crystals might enable the exploration of similar phenomena investigated using more traditional solids, such as micro-mechanical oscillators20.

Title: Franck–Condon blockade in suspended carbon nanotube quantum dots
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 06 April 2009

Abstract:
The remarkably strong coupling between the electronic and vibrational modes of suspended carbon nanotube quantum dots provides a new way of studying quantized mechanical motion. Understanding the influence of vibrational motion of the atoms on electronic transitions in molecules constitutes a cornerstone of quantum physics, as epitomized by the Franck–Condon principle1,2 of spectroscopy. Recent advances in building molecular-electronics devices3 and nanoelectromechanical systems4 open a new arena for studying the interaction between mechanical and electronic degrees of freedom in transport at the single-molecule level. The tunnelling of electrons through molecules or suspended quantum dots5,6 has been shown to excite vibrational modes, or vibrons6,7,8,9. Beyond this effect, theory predicts that strong electron–vibron coupling strongly suppresses the current flow at low biases, a collective behaviour known as Franck–Condon blockade10,11. Here, we show measurements on quantum dots formed in suspended single-wall carbon nanotubes revealing a remarkably large electron–vibron coupling that, owing to the high quality and unprecedented tunability of our samples, allow a quantitative analysis of vibron-mediated electronic transport in the regime of strong electron–vibron coupling. This enables us to unambiguously demonstrate the Franck–Condon blockade in a suspended nanostructure. The large observed electron–vibron coupling could ultimately be a key ingredient for the detection of quantized mechanical motion12,13. It also emphasizes the unique potential for nanoelectromechanical device applications based on suspended graphene sheets and carbon nanotubes.

Title: Impulsive orientation and alignment of quantum-state-selected NO molecules
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 22 March 2009

Abstract:
A technique that produces significant alignment of molecules in a beam should aid a wide range of experiments geared towards understanding and controlling molecular processes in the gas phase. Manipulation of the molecular-axis distribution is an important ingredient in experiments aimed at understanding and controlling molecular processes1,2,3,4,5,6. Samples of aligned or oriented molecules can be obtained following the interaction with an intense laser field7,8,9, enabling experiments in the molecular rather than the laboratory frame10,11,12. However, the degree of impulsive molecular orientation and alignment that can be achieved using a single laser field is limited13 and crucially depends on the initial states, which are thermally populated. Here we report the successful demonstration of a new technique for laser-field-free orientation and alignment of molecules that combines an electrostatic field, non-resonant femtosecond laser excitation14 and the preparation of state-selected molecules using a hexapole2. As a unique quantum-mechanical wavepacket is formed, a large degree of orientation and alignment is observed both during and after the femtosecond laser pulse, which is even further increased (to 〈cosθ〉=−0.74 and 〈cos2θ〉=0.82, respectively) by tailoring the shape of the femtosecond laser pulse. This work should enable new applications such as the study of reaction dynamics or collision experiments in the molecular frame, and orbital tomography11 of heteronuclear molecules.

Title: Preparation of non-local superpositions of quasi-classical light states
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 08 February 2009

Abstract:
Quantum superpositions of coherent light waves offer several advantages for quantum-information processing compared to single photons. A novel scheme for generating these so-called Schrödinger-cat states circumvents problems arising from their fragility, which has been a key obstacle towards applications. ‘Schrödinger cat’ states of light1, defined as quantum superpositions of quasi-classical coherent states, have recently emerged as an alternative to single-photon qubits for quantum-information processing2,3,4,5,6. Their richer structure provides significant advantages for quantum teleportation, universal quantum computation, high-precision measurements and fundamental tests of quantum physics7,8,9,10,11,12,13. Local superpositions of free-propagating coherent states have been realized experimentally, but their applications were so far limited by their extreme sensitivity to losses, and by the lack of quantum gates for coherent qubit rotations. Here, we demonstrate a simple approach to generating strongly entangled non-local superpositions of coherent states, using a very lossy quantum channel. Such superpositions should be useful for implementing coherent qubit-rotation gates, and for teleporting these qubits over long distances. The generation scheme may be extended to creating entangled coherent superpositions with arbitrarily large amplitudes.

Title: Frequency-specific flow control in microfluidic circuits with passive elastomeric features
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 01 February 2009

Abstract:
Frequency-specific components that passively control the flow in a channel in an analogous manner to that of the resistors, capacitors and diodes of an electronic circuit could eliminate the need to exert active control in microfluidic circuits with bulky external pumps. A fundamental challenge in the design of microfluidic devices lies in the need to control the transport of fluid according to complex patterns in space and time, and with sufficient accuracy. Although strategies based on externally actuated valves have enabled marked breakthroughs in chip-based analysis1,2,3,4,5, this requires significant off-chip hardware, such as vacuum pumps and switching solenoids, which strongly tethers such devices to laboratory environments6,7,8,9,10. Severing the microfluidic chip from this off-chip hardware would enable a new generation of devices that place the power of microfluidics in a broader range of disciplines. For example, complete on-chip flow control would empower highly portable microfluidic tools for diagnostics, forensics, environmental analysis and food safety, and be particularly useful in field settings where infrastructure is limited. Here, we demonstrate an elegantly simple strategy for flow control: fluidic networks with embedded deformable features are shown to transport fluid selectively in response to the frequency of a time-modulated pressure source. Distinct fluidic flow patterns are activated through the dynamic control of a single pressure input, akin to the analog responses of passive electrical circuits composed of resistors, capacitors and diodes.

Title: Attosecond phase locking of harmonics emitted from laser-produced plasmas
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 14 December 2008

Abstract:
An experiment demonstrating the generation of subfemtosecond pulses of light through the interaction of laser light with a solid target underlines the potential of this approach to lead to a new generation of intense sources of attosecond pulses. Laser-driven coherent extreme-ultraviolet (XUV) sources provide pulses lasting a few hundred attoseconds1,2, enabling real-time access to dynamic changes of the electronic structure of matter3,4, the fastest processes outside the atomic nucleus. These pulses, however, are typically rather weak. Exploiting the ultrahigh brilliance of accelerator-based XUV sources5 and the unique time structure of their laser-based counterparts would open intriguing opportunities in ultrafast X-ray and high-field science, extending powerful nonlinear optical and pump–probe techniques towards X-ray frequencies, and paving the way towards unequalled radiation intensities. Relativistic laser–plasma interactions have been identified as a promising approach to achieve this goal6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13. Recent experiments confirmed that relativistically driven overdense plasmas are able to convert infrared laser light into harmonic XUV radiation with unparalleled efficiency, and demonstrated the scalability of the generation technique towards hard X-rays14,15,16,17,18,19. Here we show that the phases of the XUV harmonics emanating from the interaction processes are synchronized, and therefore enable attosecond temporal bunching. Along with the previous findings concerning energy conversion and recent advances in high-power laser technology, our experiment demonstrates the feasibility of confining unprecedented amounts of light energy to within less than one&nbsp;femtosecond.

Title: Simplifying quantum logic using higher-dimensional Hilbert spaces
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 07 December 2008

Abstract:
Quantum computation promises to solve fundamental, yet otherwise intractable, problems across a range of active fields of research. Recently, universal quantum logic-gate sets—the elemental building blocks for a quantum computer—have been demonstrated in several physical architectures. A serious obstacle to a full-scale implementation is the large number of these gates required to build even small quantum circuits. Here, we present and demonstrate a general technique that harnesses multi-level information carriers to significantly reduce this number, enabling the construction of key quantum circuits with existing technology. We present implementations of two key quantum circuits: the three-qubit Toffoli gate and the general two-qubit controlled-unitary gate. Although our experiment is carried out in a photonic architecture, the technique is independent of the particular physical encoding of quantum information, and has the potential for wider application. A general approach to simplifying quantum logic circuits—the ‘programs’ of quantum computers—is described and demonstrated on a platform based on photonic qubits.

Title: Giant spin-accumulation signal and pure spin-current-induced reversible magnetization switching
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 05 October 2008

Abstract:
A key element in spintronics is the spin-transfer effect, by which the magnetization in a nanomagnet can be switched. The effect has already been demonstrated using spin-polarized electrical currents, but now reversible magnetization switching has been achieved using a pure, chargeless spin current. A number of proposed next-generation electronic devices, including novel memory elements1 and versatile transistor circuits2, rely on spin currents, that is, the flow of electron angular momentum. A spin current may interact with a magnetic nanostructure and give rise to spin-dependent transport phenomena, or excite magnetization dynamics1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11. In contrast to a spin-polarized charge current, a pure spin current does not produce any charge-related spurious effects12,13. One way to produce a pure spin current is non-local electrical-spin injection12,13,14,15,16,17,18, but this approach has suffered so far from low injection efficiency. Here, we demonstrate a significant enhancement of the non-local injection efficiency in a lateral spin valve prepared with an entirely in situ fabrication process. Improvements to the interface quality and the device structure lead to an increase of the spin-signal amplitude by an order of magnitude. The generated pure spin current enables the magnetization reversal of a nanomagnet with the same efficiency as in the case of using charge currents. These results are important for further theoretical developments in multi-terminal structures2, but also with a view towards realizing novel devices driven by pure spin currents.

Title: Control of speed and efficiency of ultrafast demagnetization by direct transfer of spin angular momentum
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 28 September 2008

Abstract:
Separating two ferromagnetic layers with an appropriately chosen spacing layer enables the transfer of spin between the two, which increases the speed and degree of demagnetization induced by a laser pulse. Since the discovery in 1996 that the magnetization of a nickel thin film is reduced within a few picoseconds after femtosecond-laser excitation1, ultrafast demagnetization has attracted a thriving interest. This attraction is driven by the twofold challenge of understanding magnetization dynamics in a strongly out-of-equilibrium regime and controlling the magnetic properties of materials on the subpicosecond timescale, with potential applications in spintronics. In the past decade significant progress has been made in understanding the microscopic processes that govern ultrafast demagnetization2,3,4,5,6,7. The discussion has been particularly focused on the role of angular-momentum conservation during the demagnetization process8,9,10. Here, using the time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect, we demonstrate that interlayer transfer of spin angular momentum in specially engineered Co/Pt multilayers speeds up the demagnetization process, bypassing the mechanism responsible for the conservation of total angular momentum taking place in a single ferromagnetic layer. This new channel for spin-angular-momentum dissipation leads to a reduction of the demagnetization time of up to 25%, accompanied by an increase of the total demagnetization by almost the same amount.

The physical properties of anisotropic fluids can be manipulated on very short length scales of 100 nm or less by appropriate treatment of the confining substrate(s)1,2. This facilitates the use of ordered fluids in a variety of scientific endeavours and applications. Although future advances will require a complete understanding of their structure at the nanoscale level, high-resolution three-dimensional optical imaging of the fluid’s molecular orientation profile is beyond the reach of extant techniques3. Here, we report a powerful imaging approach based on the collection of transmitted light in the far field that is emitted from a light source with a subwavelength aperture. We acquire high-resolution images by raster-scanning, at multiple heights, an optical fibre immersed inside a thin layer of anisotropic fluid, thereby facilitating the visualization of the fluid’s structure with a resolvable volume ∼1/500 of that attainable by current methods. This novel technique offers the intriguing possibility of three-dimensional nanoscale reconstruction of a variety of soft materials, here the first direct visualization and measurement of the liquid-crystal molecular orientation relaxation length.

Title: Time-resolved dynamics of the spin Hall effect
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 14 September 2008

Abstract:
When current is passed through certain semiconductors or metals, spins of opposite sign accumulate on opposing boundaries. The phenomenon is known as the spin Hall effect, and now, for the first time, its dynamics has been measured directly. The generation and manipulation of carrier spin polarization in semiconductors solely by electric fields has garnered significant attention as both an interesting manifestation of spin–orbit physics as well as a valuable capability for potential spintronics devices1,2,3,4. One realization of these spin–orbit phenomena, the spin Hall effect5,6, has been studied as a means of all-electrical spin-current generation and spin separation in both semiconductor and metallic systems. Previous measurements of the spin Hall effect7,8,9,10,11 have focused on steady-state generation and time-averaged detection, without directly addressing the accumulation dynamics on the timescale of the spin-coherence time. Here, we demonstrate time-resolved measurement of the dynamics of spin accumulation generated by the extrinsic spin Hall effect in a doped GaAs semiconductor channel. Using electrically pumped time-resolved Kerr rotation, we image the accumulation, precession and decay dynamics near the channel boundary with spatial and temporal resolution and identify multiple evolution time constants. We model these processes with time-dependent diffusion analysis using both exact and numerical solution techniques and find that the underlying physical spin-coherence time differs from the dynamical rates of spin accumulation and decay observed near the sample&nbsp;edges.

Title: Efficient state transfer in an ultracold dense gas of heteronuclear molecules
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 22 June 2008

Abstract:
A rich internal structure and long-range interactions between them make molecules with non-vanishing dipole moments interesting for many applications. An experiment demonstrating the efficient transfer of loosely bound heteronuclear molecules into more deeply bound energy levels indicates a route towards producing dense ensembles of cold polar molecules. Polar molecules have bright prospects for novel quantum gases with long-range and anisotropic interactions1, and could find uses in quantum information science2 and in precision measurements3,4,5. However, high-density clouds of ultracold polar molecules have so far not been produced. Here, we report a key step towards this goal. We start from an ultracold dense gas of loosely bound 40K87Rb Feshbach molecules6,7 with typical binding energies of a few hundred kilohertz, and coherently transfer these molecules in a single transfer step into a vibrational level of the ground-state molecular potential bound by more than 10 GHz. Starting with a single initial state prepared with Feshbach association8, we achieve a transfer efficiency of 84%. Given favourable Franck–Condon factors9,10, the presented technique can be extended to access much more deeply bound vibrational levels and those exhibiting a significant dipole moment.

Title: Spin blockade and lifetime-enhanced transport in a few-electron Si/SiGe double quantum dot
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 08 June 2008

Abstract:
The observation of spin blockade and lifetime-enhanced transport effects in Si/SiGe double quantum dots represents a promising step in the development of silicon-based quantum devices. Spin blockade occurs when an electron is unable to access an energetically favourable path through a quantum dot owing to spin conservation, resulting in a blockade of the current through the dot1,2,3,4,5,6. Spin blockade is the basis of a number of recent advances in spintronics, including the measurement and the manipulation of individual electron spins7,8. We report measurements of the spin blockade regime in a silicon double quantum dot, revealing a complementary phenomenon: lifetime-enhanced transport. We argue that our observations arise because the decay times for electron spins in silicon are long, enabling the electron to maintain its spin throughout its transit across the quantum dot and access fast paths that exist in some spin channels but not in others. Such long spin lifetimes are important for applications such as quantum computation and, more generally, spintronics.

Title: Dirac charge dynamics in graphene by infrared spectroscopy
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 08 June 2008

Abstract:
Infrared spectra of graphene deposited on a silicon oxide substrate suggest that many-body effects have a more significant role in determining its electronic behaviour than in free-standing graphene A remarkable manifestation of the quantum character of electrons in matter is offered by graphene, a single atomic layer of graphite. Unlike conventional solids where electrons are described with the Schrödinger equation, electronic excitations in graphene are governed by the Dirac hamiltonian1. Some of the intriguing electronic properties of graphene, such as massless Dirac quasiparticles with linear energy–momentum dispersion, have been confirmed by recent observations2,3,4,5. Here, we report an infrared spectromicroscopy study of charge dynamics in graphene integrated in gated devices. Our measurements verify the expected characteristics of graphene and, owing to the previously unattainable accuracy of infrared experiments, also uncover significant departures of the quasiparticle dynamics from predictions made for Dirac fermions in idealized, free-standing graphene. Several observations reported here indicate the relevance of many-body interactions to the electromagnetic response of graphene.

Title: Surface heating of wire plasmas using laser-irradiated cone geometries
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 28 October 2007

Abstract:
Petawatt lasers can generate extreme states of matter, making them unique tools for high-energy-density physics. Pressures in the gigabar regime can potentially be generated with cone-wire targets when the coupling efficiency is high and temperatures reach 2–4 keV (ref.&nbsp;1). The only other method of obtaining such gigantic pressures is to use the megajoule laser facilities being constructed (National Ignition Facility and Laser MégaJoule). The energy can be transported over surprisingly long distances but, until now, the guiding mechanism has remained unclear. Here, we present the first definitive experimental proof that the heating is maximized close to the wire surface, by comparison of interferometric measurements with hydrodynamic simulations. New hybrid particle-in-cell simulations show the complex field structures for the first time, including a reversal of the magnetic field on the inside of the wire. This increases the return current in a spatially separated thin layer below the wire surface, resulting in the enhanced level of ohmic heating. There are a significant number of applications in high-energy-density science, ranging from equation-of-state studies to bright, hard X-ray sources, that will benefit from this new understanding of energy transport.

Title: Electrical spin-injection into silicon from a ferromagnetic metal/tunnel barrier contact
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 15 July 2007

Abstract:
The electron’s spin angular momentum is one of several alternative state variables under consideration on the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) for processing information in the fundamentally new ways that will be required beyond the ultimate scaling limits of silicon-based complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor technology1. Electrical injection/transport of spin-polarized carriers is prerequisite for developing such an approach2,3. Although significant progress has been realized in GaAs (ref.&nbsp;4), little progress has been made in Si, despite its overwhelming dominance of the semiconductor industry. Here, we report successful injection of spin-polarized electrons from an iron film through an Al2O3 tunnel barrier into Si(001). The circular polarization of the electroluminescence resulting from radiative recombination in Si and in GaAs (in Si/AlGaAs/GaAs structures) tracks the Fe magnetization, confirming that these spin-polarized electrons originate from the Fe contact. The polarization reflects Fe majority spin. We determine a lower bound for the Si electron spin polarization of 10%, and obtain an estimate of ∼30% at 5 K, with significant polarization extending to at least 125 K. We further demonstrate spin transport across the Si/AlGaAs interface.

Title: Entangled Andreev pairs and collective excitations in nanoscale superconductors
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 13 May 2007

Abstract:
Nanoscale superconductors connected to normal metallic electrodes provide a potential source of entangled electron pairs1,2,3,4,5. Such states would arise from the splitting of Cooper pairs in the superconductor into two electrons with opposite spins, which then tunnel into different leads by means of a process known as crossed Andreev reflection (refs&nbsp;6, 7, 8). In an actual system, the detection of these processes is hindered by the elastic transmission of individual electrons between the leads, which yields an opposite contribution to the non-local conductance. Here we demonstrate that low-energy collective excitations, which appear in superconducting structures of reduced dimensionality9, can have a significant influence on the transport properties of this type of hybrid nanostructure. When an electron tunnels into the superconductor it can excite such low-energy excitations that alter the balance between the different electronic processes, leading to a dominance of one over the other depending on the spatial symmetry of these excitations. These findings help to clarify some intriguing experimental results and provide future strategies for the detection of entangled electron pairs in solid-state devices for quantum computation.

Title: Breaking the delay-bandwidth limit in a photonic structure
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 22 April 2007

Abstract:
Storing light on-chip, which requires that the speed of light be significantly slowed down, is crucial for enabling photonic circuits on-chip. Ultraslow propagation1,2,3 and even stopping4,5 of light have been demonstrated using the electromagnetically induced transparency effect in atomic systems1,3,4,5 and the coherent population oscillation effect in solid-state systems2. The wavelengths and bandwidths of light in such devices are tightly constrained by the property of the material absorption lines, which limits their application in information technologies. Various slow-light devices based on photonic structures have also been demonstrated6,7,8,9,10; however, these devices suffer a fundamental trade-off between the transmission bandwidth and the optical delay. It has been shown theoretically11,12,13 that stopping light on-chip and thereby breaking the fundamental link between the delay and the bandwidth can be achieved by ultrafast tuning of photonic structures. Using this mechanism, here we report the first demonstration of storing light using photonic structures on-chip, with storage times longer than the bandwidth-determined photon lifetime of the static device. The release time of the pulse is externally controlled.

Title: Plasma mirrors for ultrahigh-intensity optics
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 15 April 2007

Abstract:
Specular reflection is one of the most fundamental processes of optics. At moderate light intensities generated by conventional light sources this process is well understood. But at those capable of being produced by modern ultrahigh-intensity lasers, many new and potentially useful phenomena arise. When a pulse from such a laser hits an optically polished surface, it generates a dense plasma that itself acts as a mirror, known as a plasma mirror (PM). PMs do not just reflect the remainder of the incident beam, but can act as active optical elements. Using a set of three consecutive PMs in different regimes, we significantly improve the temporal contrast of femtosecond pulses, and demonstrate that high-order harmonics of the laser frequency can be generated through two distinct mechanisms. A better understanding of these processes should aid the development of laser-driven attosecond sources for use in fields from materials science to molecular biology.

Title: Efficient unidirectional nanoslit couplers for surface plasmons
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 08 April 2007

Abstract:
The emerging field of plasmonics is based on exploiting the coupling between light and collective electronic excitations within conducting materials known as surface plasmons. Because the so-called surface plasmon polariton (SPP) modes that arise from this coupling are not constrained by the optical diffraction limit, it is hoped that they could enable the construction of ultracompact optical components1,2. But in order that such potential can be realized, it is vital that the relatively poor light–SPP coupling be improved. This is made worse by the fact that the incident light that is conventionally used to launch SPPs in a metal film 3,4,5,6 is a significant source of noise, unless directed away from a region of interest, which then decreases the signal and increases the system’s size. Back-side illumination of subwavelength apertures in optically thick metal films7,8,9,10,11,12,13 eliminates this problem but does not ensure a unique propagation direction for the SPP. We propose a novel back-side slit-illumination method that incorporates a periodic array of grooves carved into the front side of a thick metal film. Bragg reflection enhances the propagation of SPPs away from the array, enabling them to be unidirectionally launched from, and focused to, a localized point.

Title: Mapping surface plasmons on a single metallic nanoparticle
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 01 April 2007

Abstract:
Understanding how light interacts with matter at the nanometre scale is a fundamental issue in optoelectronics and nanophotonics. In particular, many applications (such as bio-sensing, cancer therapy and all-optical signal processing) rely on surface-bound optical excitations in metallic nanoparticles. However, so far no experimental technique has been capable of imaging localized optical excitations with sufficient resolution to reveal their dramatic spatial variation over one single nanoparticle. Here, we present a novel method applied on silver nanotriangles, achieving such resolution by recording maps of plasmons in the near-infrared/visible/ultraviolet domain using electron beams instead of photons. This method relies on the detection of plasmons as resonance peaks in the energy-loss spectra of subnanometre electron beams rastered on nanoparticles of well-defined geometrical parameters. This represents a significant improvement in the spatial resolution with which plasmonic modes can be imaged, and provides a powerful tool in the development of nanometre-level optics.

Title: Effects of disorder on electron spin dynamics in a semiconductor quantum well
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 11 February 2007

Abstract:
Using the spin of the electron to carry information, instead of or in addition to its charge, could provide advances in the capabilities of microelectronics. Successful implementation of spin-based electronics requires preservation of the electron spin coherence. In n-doped semiconductors, long spin-coherence times have been observed, with a maximum at a ‘magic’ electron density. Here, we vary the density in a two-dimensional electron gas, and show that spin coherence is lost because of the interplay between localization by disorder and dynamical scattering. By measuring the electron Landé g-factor dependence on density, we determine the density of states (DOS), which characterizes the disorder potential. Using our knowledge of the DOS, a simple model estimates the temperature and excitation intensity dependence of the g factor, qualitatively agreeing with experiments. This agreement confirms the importance of disorder and provides predictive power for designing spin-based electronic devices.

Title: Conditional control of the quantum states of remote atomic memories for quantum networking
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 29 October 2006

Abstract:
Quantum networks hold the promise for revolutionary advances in information processing with quantum resources distributed over remote locations via quantum-repeater architectures. Quantum networks are composed of nodes for storing and processing quantum states, and of channels for transmitting states between them. The scalability of such networks relies critically on the ability to carry out conditional operations on states stored in separated quantum memories. Here, we report the first implementation of such conditional control of two atomic memories, located in distinct apparatuses, which results in a 28-fold increase of the probability of simultaneously obtaining a pair of single photons, relative to the case without conditional control. As a first application, we demonstrate a high degree of indistinguishability for remotely generated single photons by the observation of destructive interference of their wave packets. Our results demonstrate experimentally a basic principle for enabling scalable quantum networks, with applications also to linear optics quantum computation.

Title: Dispersionless slow light using gap solitons
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 22 October 2006

Abstract:
The ability to slow down and delay optical pulses is an intriguing physical phenomenon with significant applications, such as in telecommunications. It is essential for these applications that the phenomenon has enough bandwidth, so that it can respond sufficiently fast to the very short light pulses that will carry the information in future telecommunications systems. However, typical slow-light systems exhibit dispersion, which distorts the pulses on propagation, leading to loss of information, thereby limiting the bandwidth. This limitation imposes a trade-off between the acquired delay and the system’s bandwidth. By introducing nonlinearity, however, the pulse can travel slowly and also remain undistorted over arbitrarily long propagation lengths by the formation of a soliton. We observe such solitons in a fibre Bragg grating, and show that subnanosecond pulses travel at 16% of the speed of light, without broadening.

Title: Measuring and controlling the birth of attosecond XUV pulses
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 15 October 2006

Abstract:
Generating attosecond pulses has required a radically different approach from previous ultrafast optical methods. The technology of attosecond measurement, however, is built on established methods of characterizing femtosecond pulses: the pulse is measured after it has left the region where it was produced. We offer a completely different approach: in situ measurement. That is, we integrate attosecond-pulse production and measurement in a manner that can be applied to many high-order nonlinear interactions. To demonstrate this approach, we combine a low-intensity (&lt;10−3) second-harmonic beam with the fundamental beam, to gently perturb the production process without significantly modifying it. The attosecond-pulse duration is read from the modulation of the even-harmonic signal as a function of the two-field delay. Increasing the second-harmonic intensity slightly (&lt;10−2), we extend measurement to control. We demonstrate control by manipulating the high-harmonic spectrum with high efficiency.

Title: The effect of Auger heating on intraband carrier relaxation in semiconductor quantum rods
Science Subject: Physics
Date: 23 July 2006

Abstract:
The rate at which excited charge carriers relax to their equilibrium state affects many aspects of the performance of nanoscale devices, including switching speed, carrier mobility and luminescence efficiency. A better understanding of the processes that govern carrier relaxation therefore has important technological implications. A significant increase in carrier–carrier interactions caused by strong spatial confinement of electronic excitations in semiconductor nanostructures leads to a considerable enhancement of Auger effects, which can further result in unusual, Auger-process-controlled recombination and energy relaxation regimes. Here, we report the first experimental observation of efficient Auger heating in CdSe quantum rods at high pump intensities, leading to a strong reduction of carrier cooling rates. In this regime, the carrier temperature is determined by the balance between energy outflow through phonon emission and energy inflow because of Auger heating. This equilibrium results in peculiar carrier cooling dynamics that closely correlate with recombination dynamics, an effect never seen before in bulk or nanoscale&nbsp;semiconductors.

Abstract:
Quantum ballistic transport in electron waveguides (EWGs)1,2&nbsp;is based on coherent quantum states arising from the one-dimensional (1D) confinement in nanometre-scale constrictions. Semiconductor EWGs have received considerable renewed interest for quantum logic devices3,4,5,6,7 and theoretical concepts8,9,10,11 in the context of solid-state quantum information processing12. Implementation in real-world quantum circuits requires the unambiguous experimental distinction between all involved energy levels. However, such knowledge of EWGs investigated for wavefunction hybridization13,14,15 is solely based on estimates. Here, we present coupled EWGs that allow single-mode control and manipulation of mode coupling at temperatures as high as that of liquid-helium (4.2&nbsp;K) and above. We demonstrate high-resolution energy spectroscopy of each EWG subband ladder and the 1D coupled states involved. The results verify the power of advanced nanolithography and its ability to open the door to the scalable semiconductor quantum circuits envisaged today.

Abstract:
The electromagnetic manipulation of isolated atoms has led to many advances in physics, from laser cooling1 and Bose–Einstein condensation of cold gases2 to the precise quantum control of individual atomic ions3. Work on miniaturizing electromagnetic traps to the micrometre scale promises even higher levels of control and reliability4. Compared with ‘chip traps’ for confining neutral atoms5,6,7, ion traps with similar dimensions and power dissipation offer much higher confinement forces and allow unparalleled control at the single-atom level. Moreover, ion microtraps are of great interest in the development of miniature mass-spectrometer arrays8, compact atomic clocks9 and, most notably, large-scale quantum information processors10,11. Here we report the operation of a micrometre-scale ion trap, fabricated on a monolithic chip using semiconductor micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) technology.

Title: Overcoming the barrier of orbital-free density functional theory for molecular systems using deep learning
Science Subject: Computational Science
Date: 11 March 2024

Abstract:
Orbital-free density functional theory (OFDFT) is a quantum chemistry formulation that has a lower cost scaling than the prevailing Kohn–Sham DFT, which is increasingly desired for contemporary molecular research. However, its accuracy is limited by the kinetic energy density functional, which is notoriously hard to approximate for non-periodic molecular systems. Here we propose M-OFDFT, an OFDFT approach capable of solving molecular systems using a deep learning functional model. We build the essential non-locality into the model, which is made affordable by the concise density representation as expansion coefficients under an atomic basis. With techniques to address unconventional learning challenges therein, M-OFDFT achieves a comparable accuracy to Kohn–Sham DFT on a wide range of molecules untouched by OFDFT before. More attractively, M-OFDFT extrapolates well to molecules much larger than those seen in training, which unleashes the appealing scaling of OFDFT for studying large molecules including proteins, representing an advancement of the accuracy–efficiency trade-off frontier in quantum chemistry. M-OFDFT is a deep learning implementation of orbital-free density functional theory (OFDFT) that achieves DFT-level accuracy on molecular systems with lower cost complexity, and can extrapolate to much larger molecules than those seen during training.

Title: Guided diffusion for inverse molecular design

Date: 05 October 2023

Abstract:
The holy grail of materials science is de novo molecular design, meaning engineering molecules with desired characteristics. The introduction of generative deep learning has greatly advanced efforts in this direction, yet molecular discovery remains challenging and often inefficient. Herein we introduce GaUDI, a guided diffusion model for inverse molecular design that combines an equivariant graph neural net for property prediction and a generative diffusion model. We demonstrate GaUDI’s effectiveness in designing molecules for organic electronic applications by using single- and multiple-objective tasks applied to a generated dataset of 475,000 polycyclic aromatic systems. GaUDI shows improved conditional design, generating molecules with optimal properties and even going beyond the original distribution to suggest better molecules than those in the dataset. In addition to point-wise targets, GaUDI can also be guided toward open-ended targets (for example, a minimum or maximum) and in all cases achieves close to 100% validity of generated molecules. GaUDI is a guided diffusion method for the design of molecular structures that features a flexible and scalable target function and that achieves high validity of generated molecules.

Title: Defect graph neural networks for materials discovery in high-temperature clean-energy applications

Date: 10 August 2023

Abstract:
We present a graph neural network approach that fully automates the prediction of defect formation enthalpies for any crystallographic site from the ideal crystal structure, without the need to create defected atomic structure models as input. Here we used density functional theory reference data for vacancy defects in oxides, to train a defect graph neural network (dGNN) model that replaces the density functional theory supercell relaxations otherwise required for each symmetrically unique crystal site. Interfaced with thermodynamic calculations of reduction entropies and associated free energies, the dGNN model is applied to the screening of oxides in the Materials Project database, connecting the zero-kelvin defect enthalpies to high-temperature process conditions relevant for solar thermochemical hydrogen production and other energy applications. The dGNN approach is applicable to arbitrary structures with an accuracy limited principally by the amount and diversity of the training data, and it is generalizable to other defect types and advanced graph convolution architectures. It will help to tackle future materials discovery problems in clean energy and beyond. Automating materials’ defect predictions with graph neural networks, when coupled to first principles thermodynamic calculations, accelerates materials discovery for a variety of high-temperature, clean-energy applications.

Title: Theory of overparametrization in quantum neural networks
Science Subject: Computational Science
Date: 26 June 2023

Abstract:
The prospect of achieving quantum advantage with quantum neural networks (QNNs) is exciting. Understanding how QNN properties (for example, the number of parameters M) affect the loss landscape is crucial to designing scalable QNN architectures. Here we rigorously analyze the overparametrization phenomenon in QNNs, defining overparametrization as the regime where the QNN has more than a critical number of parameters Mc allowing it to explore all relevant directions in state space. Our main results show that the dimension of the Lie algebra obtained from the generators of the QNN is an upper bound for Mc, and for the maximal rank that the quantum Fisher information and Hessian matrices can reach. Underparametrized QNNs have spurious local minima in the loss landscape that start disappearing when M ≥ Mc. Thus, the overparametrization onset corresponds to a computational phase transition where the QNN trainability is greatly improved. We then connect the notion of overparametrization to the QNN capacity, so that when a QNN is overparametrized, its capacity achieves its maximum possible value. A theoretical framework for quantum neural network (QNN) overparametrization, a phase transition in loss landscape complexity, is established. The precise characterization of the critical number of parameters offered is expected to impact QNN design.

Title: Simultaneously improving reaction coverage and computational cost in automated reaction prediction tasks
Science Subject: Computational Science
Date: 22 July 2021

Abstract:
Automated reaction prediction has the potential to elucidate complex reaction networks for applications ranging from combustion to materials degradation, but computational cost and inconsistent reaction coverage are still obstacles to exploring deep reaction networks. Here we show that cost can be reduced and reaction coverage can be increased simultaneously by relatively straightforward modifications of the reaction enumeration, geometry initialization and transition state convergence algorithms that are common to many prediction methodologies. These components are implemented in the context of yet another reaction program (YARP), our reaction prediction package with which we report reaction discovery benchmarks for organic single-step reactions, thermal degradation of a γ-ketohydroperoxide, and competing ring-closures in a large organic molecule. Compared with recent benchmarks, YARP (re)discovers both established and unreported reaction pathways and products while simultaneously reducing the cost of reaction characterization by nearly 100-fold and increasing convergence of transition states. This combination of ultra-low cost and high reaction coverage creates opportunities to explore the reactivity of larger systems and more complex reaction networks for applications such as chemical degradation, where computational cost is a bottleneck. This work demonstrates that large gains still exist in accelerating and improving the coverage of reaction prediction algorithms. These advances create opportunities for computationally exploring deeper and broader reaction networks.

Title: Rapid assessment of T-cell receptor specificity of the immune repertoire
Science Subject: Computational Science
Date: 24 May 2021

Abstract:
Accurate assessment of T-cell-receptor (TCR)–antigen specificity across the whole immune repertoire lies at the heart of improved cancer immunotherapy, but predictive models capable of high-throughput assessment of TCR–peptide pairs are lacking. Recent advances in deep sequencing and crystallography have enriched the data available for studying TCR–peptide systems. Here, we introduce RACER, a pairwise energy model capable of rapid assessment of TCR–peptide affinity for entire immune repertoires. RACER applies supervised machine learning to efficiently and accurately resolve strong TCR–peptide binding pairs from weak ones. The trained parameters further enable a physical interpretation of interacting patterns encoded in each TCR–peptide system. When applied to simulate thymic selection of a major-histocompatibility-complex (MHC)-restricted T-cell repertoire, RACER accurately estimates recognition rates for tumor-associated neoantigens and foreign peptides, thus demonstrating its utility in helping address the computational challenge of reliably identifying properties of tumor antigen-specific T-cells at the level of an individual patient’s immune repertoire. Predicting binding specificity of T-cell receptors (TCRs) and putative antigens can help improve cancer immunotherapy. Lin et al. propose RACER, which efficiently makes use of supervised machine learning to learn important molecular interactions contributing to TCR–peptide binding.
