              IMPROVEMENT VALUE (IV) CHEAT SHEET
===============================================================

Key Dimensions: Usability | Efficiency | Satisfaction | Impact

---------------------------------------------------------------
1. USABILITY METRICS
---------------------------------------------------------------
- Task Completion Rate:
  Formula: (Number of successful tasks / Total tasks attempted) × 100
  Purpose: Measure success in task completion after improvements.

- Error Rate:
  Formula: Total errors made / Total opportunities for error
  Purpose: Track how usability improvements reduce errors.

- Time on Task:
  Formula: Total time spent by all users / Number of users
  Purpose: Analyze time saved by users in completing tasks.

---------------------------------------------------------------
2. EFFICIENCY METRICS
---------------------------------------------------------------
- Time Savings:
  Formula: ((Old process time - New process time) / Old process time) × 100
  Purpose: Measure time reduction in completing a process.

- Cost Reduction:
  Formula: ((Old cost - New cost) / Old cost) × 100
  Purpose: Assess percentage decrease in costs after improvements.

- Productivity Gains:
  Formula: ((Output after improvement - Output before improvement) / 
            Output before improvement) × 100
  Purpose: Evaluate increased productivity after changes.

---------------------------------------------------------------
3. SATISFACTION METRICS
---------------------------------------------------------------
- Net Promoter Score (NPS):
  Formula: Percentage of Promoters - Percentage of Detractors
  Purpose: Gauge customer loyalty and likelihood to recommend.

- Customer Satisfaction (CSAT):
  Formula: (Number of satisfied responses / Total responses) × 100
  Purpose: Measure customer satisfaction post-improvement.

- Customer Retention Rate:
  Formula: ((Customers at end of period - New customers) / 
            Customers at start of period) × 100
  Purpose: Assess retention of customers after improvements.

---------------------------------------------------------------
4. IMPACT METRICS
---------------------------------------------------------------
- Revenue Growth:
  Formula: ((Revenue after improvement - Revenue before improvement) / 
            Revenue before improvement) × 100
  Purpose: Measure the increase in revenue due to improvements.

- Market Share:
  Formula: (Your total sales / Total industry sales) × 100
  Purpose: Track competitive position post-improvement.

- Return on Investment (ROI):
  Formula: (Net Gain from Improvements / Total Improvement Cost) × 100
  Purpose: Evaluate the financial return of the improvements.

---------------------------------------------------------------
5. OVERALL IMPROVEMENT VALUE (IV)
---------------------------------------------------------------
Formula: IV = w_U × U + w_E × E + w_S × S + w_I × I
  - U = Usability score
  - E = Efficiency score
  - S = Satisfaction score
  - I = Impact score
  - w_U, w_E, w_S, w_I = Weights assigned to each dimension
  (Weights should sum to 1, based on business priorities)

Purpose: Calculate a holistic value reflecting overall improvement.
